    Portlanders are big fans of bicycles. We love our custom saddles, our bamboo fenders, our Italian leather handlebar grips... Seriously, we're a little obsessive when it comes to eco-friendly commuting. So when Portland Design Works, a long-time client of ThinkShout, reached out to us to reimagine their e-commerce website, we couldn't have been more excited. Portland Design Works manufactures beautiful bicycle accessories designed for everyday use. They wanted to redesign their website to reflect the craftsmanship of their merchandise with strong visuals and and an easy-to-use e-commerce checkout process.

      Knowing that Portland Design Works needed to quickly relaunch the new website with support for both mobile and tablet devices, we began the project with a rapid prototyping process. First, we developed a series of style tiles that explored a variety of graphic design directions. Then, we built responsive, clickable wireframes using the Foundation prototyping framework.

      The success of this project hinged upon our execution of a complex data migration from their Drupal 6 e-commerce website to Drupal 7. Once we completed this upgrade, we were able to take advantage of many new tools available in Drupal 7 to develop new features for the website, including a custom store locator with proximity search, and Tumblr integration for easy blogging.

      After launching their new E-Commerce site, PDW saw a 25% increase in sales in the first 6 months, a 102% increase in sales of the Bird Cage H20 holder over the first year, and 47 new dealers added in the first 17 months.
