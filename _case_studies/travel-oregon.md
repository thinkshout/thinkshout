      Travel Oregon is the official tourism marketing organization for the State of Oregon. They work to enhance visitors' experiences by providing information, resources, and trip planning tools for just about any activity available in our state. Most importantly, they inspire the public to visit, and consistently convey the exceptional quality of Oregon.

  - intro-title: Challenge
    intro-text: |
      Create an experience that would invite users to discover more activities and resources throughout the site.

  - intro-title: Solution
    intro-text: |
      Leverage their editorial content (1,947 trip ideas) to contextualize the 10k+ listings that are maintained in Oregon Tourism Information System (OTIS).

  - intro-title: Results
    intro-text: |
      We crafted a stunning new design leveraging an abundance of beautiful imagery with an information architecture that drives users to the content they need to plan their visit.

      One of the things we felt strongly about in taking on this project was the concept of giving users a sense of "place." It's that feeling you get when you see an image of a location so breath-taking that you want to go see it for yourself.

      We achieved this through a feature we implemented on the homepage hero. Visit TravelOregon.com at various times of day from other time zones, and you'll be served up a scenic image from somewhere in Oregon at the local time here, in Oregon.

    section-description: |
      At first glance, visitors will notice the images and will find it very easy to dive deeper into the site down to micro-levels of content that speak to their interests. After sticking around the site a bit longer, visitors may even notice the details of whimsy.

      7 different colors for 7 different regions, the aforementioned hero image and time on the home page changing throughout the day, the Oregon skyline textures scattered across the site. Even the dashed horizontal rule has its own story, spelling out Oregon in morse code.

      There was special attention placed on mobile responsiveness and browser compatibility. Considering many visitors would potentially be exploring this site while on their Oregon vacation, we needed to ensure that accessibility wasn't hindered in any way. All content, maps, and resources needed to be seamlessly served up in the mobile experience.

      There were a lot of players involved in this rebuild. [Wieden+Kennedy](http://www.wk.com/) was responsible for the re-brand that was released midway through the project, and we worked closely with their team to apply their modern brand into our design concepts.

      We worked with Co-Operations to be sure we understood how information needed to be captured and sent to them for fulfillment of travel guides, and Tourism Engine, who manages their email list and travel newsletter. There were integrations galore, and assuring all invested parties that we would connect the dots in this complex ecosystem was no small feat.

      We built the site on WordPress (WP) -- our largest build in the platform to-date. Performance of the site on a variety of devices was key -- as part of the redesign, we focused on the performance of the platform, the code, and of course, the content.

      At the platform level, Travel Oregon selected Pantheon for their reliability, highly tuned hosting environment and the inclusion of their Fastly-backed Global CDN.

      Overall, ThinkShout maintained a strong UX narrative throughout the project lifecycle -- this project was really more about how Travel Oregon could serve their audiences and tell an attractive, content-rich story of Oregon and all that it has to offer.
