      We crafted a stunning new design leveraging an abundance of beautiful imagery with an information architecture that intuitively drives people to the content they need to plan their visit. But it’s not all good looks. The site, built on WordPress, integrates numerous backend systems including a content repository designed for Destination Management Organizations throughout the state. The new site is blazing fast, with performance wins all around. In fact, page load times decreased from over eight seconds to only five.

      One of the things we felt strongly about in taking on this project was the concept of giving site visitors a sense of “place.” It’s that feeling you get when you see an image of a location so breathtaking that you long to see it for yourself; a sort of nostalgia for a place you've never been. Lucky for us, Oregon has no shortage of impressive vistas.

      We wanted people to picture themselves here, and we achieved this through a feature we implemented on the homepage hero. Visit [TravelOregon.com](https://traveloregon.com/) and you’ll be served up a scenic image from somewhere in Oregon at the local time here-- even if you're visiting from a different timezone.

      ThinkShout maintained a strong UX narrative throughout the whole project lifecycle – focusing on how Travel Oregon could best serve their audiences and tell an attractive, content-rich story of Oregon and all that it has to offer. Additionally, we built an infrastructure that is easy for administrators to maintain and manage, saving time and costs for staff.

      The result was a site that welcomes hours of exploration and information for those considering a visit, as well as resident Oregonians themselves.

      In short, we like it here, and we think you will too.
