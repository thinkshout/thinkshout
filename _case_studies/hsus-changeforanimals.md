    intro-text: |
      Launch an online brochure that matched the print materials for thier 60th anniversary, which was only weeks away from the start of our engagement.

  - intro-title: Solution
    intro-text: |
      A static site built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), to implement a high-traffic, image-rich design that would load quickly and reliably.

  - intro-title: Results
    intro-text: |
      In seven weeks, we launched the Change for Animals campaign site.

    section-description: |
      The Humane Society was in the process of creating a print brochure, setting up events all across the country, and was about to publish a new book, all of which they hoped to promote in this online brochure. The site had to match their branding while being appealing to major donors.

      The Humane Society also wanted a quick turnaround: two months from start to finish.

    section-title: "Design Direction"
    section-description: |
      Our directive was to design and develop a website heavily inspired by an existing print brochure. The challenge became blending the print and digital world; both platforms have similar requirements, but express content completely differently.

      We spent a majority of the time during the UX phase carefully crafting a story that would appeal quickly to a user and ultimately encourage them to donate or get involved in the Humane Society’s programs.

    section-title: "Styling a Static Site"
    section-description: |
      The site needed five campaign pages, celebrity testimonials with featured videos, and a promotional section for their events. [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) was a perfect fit, and we've used it with great success on projects with similar constraints.

      Static sites are very performant, and we wanted this high-traffic, image-rich design to load quickly and reliably. When changes are checked into Github, the site is automatically deployed with Travis CI.

      We launched the Transformational Change for Animals microsite in April of 2016 and are currently measuring the analytics around the site’s performance. We hope to share our findings with you in the near future!
