      Women for Women International (WFWI) supports marginalized women in countries affected by conflict and war. They enable women to earn and save money, improve health and well-being, influence decisions in their home and community, and connect to networks for support in the countries where they have programs. By utilizing skills, knowledge, and resources, women are able to create sustainable change for themselves, their family, and their community.

  - intro-title: Challenge
    intro-text: |
      WFWI’s site suffered from  messy architecture. It was difficult to manage, and the organization needed a compelling way to share stories and communicate impact with the world.

  - intro-title: Solutions
    intro-text: |
      We partnered with Women for Women on content development to clearly state who they are and what they do. We incorporated strong use of photography and created clear user pathways for people to find the content they want.

  - intro-title: Results
    intro-text: |
      Reduced bounce rate by 21%<br>
      Increased conversion rate by 179%<br>
      Decreased abandonment rate by 8%

      For this project, it was especially critical to identify Women for Women’s core audiences and establish a foundational understanding of who was visiting their site, and how they were engaging with content. We found that Women for Women had strong initial site traffic (almost exclusively via paid advertising), but a high bounce rate. We worked with the Women for Women team to redefine how they wanted to communicate their story, their programming, and their long term impact.  We ensured that this redefined vision flowed through their design from strategy into implementation.

      To help them craft content for their new website, we created page templates that guided them in terms of length of copy and we partnered on creating strong, emotive language to drive action. It was a true partnership, reviewing what was added by the client and providing polish where needed.

      We also greatly simplified the structure of the site to make the impact of WFWI clear, which resulted in minimizing their total content by 75%. We know that succinct, readable copy is increasingly important as it relates to website accessibility and SEO rankings, and our goal was to ensure supporters didn’t miss the stories of these remarkable women.

      Of course, words alone can’t tell the full story. Luckily, WFWI had an extensive photo library that allowed us to establish the structure and visual feel for the site, while creating an emotional tie between their work and their site visitors.

      There was a lot of passion behind this project, and we were keen to make it launch successfully, despite any challenges presented along the way. The client’s team was in flux. Experiencing changes made it difficult to maintain a consistent thread, but clear and frequent communication and a passion for the mission made a smooth launch of this site possible.

      A unique aspect of this redesign (that we’re especially proud of) was that from start to finish we had an entirely female identifying team at ThinkShout working on this project. Beginning with the initial discovery and strategic direction, to wireframing and design, to the full implementation team -- what started as a coincidence ended up feeling like kismet. The intersection of respect, the emotional subject matter of WFWI’s mission, and using technology and design to tell inspiring stories led to the final product: A site that shares the stories of extraordinary women overcoming insurmountable obstacles to thrive and realize their dreams.
