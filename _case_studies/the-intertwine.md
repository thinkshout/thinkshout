    The Intertwine exists to advocate for parks and trails in the Portland metropolitan area, uniting local agencies and groups to take a vested interest in the land and promoting conservation. To be effective advocates, they needed to inform and engage their audience. First and foremost, they needed a website that could do the work for them. ThinkShout partnered with Open Plans and Substance to deliver what would become a beautiful, user-friendly web solution.

  - section-title: Discovery
    section-description: |
      The Intertwine needed to connect its constituents with the parks in its network, engagement being key in the process. There needed to be a way for park-goers to easily plan their adventures, tour routes, and learn more about the regions around them.

  - section-title: Strategy
    section-description: |
      Substance contributed a gorgeous design that really accentuated the parks’ themes. From there, we developed an interactive Leaflet map, which allowed site visitors to explore Intertwine from any device. We wanted to emphasize the beauty of the areas they sought to preserve with gorgeous image galleries and a collection of adventures comprised of parks and trails curated by the alliance.

  - section-title: Mapping
    section-description: |
      We designed an interactive map using Leaflet Javascript library. Leaflet allowed us to present visitors with a responsive map they could thoroughly explore. This included a Drupal Module that ThinkShout developed specifically for this project, featuring custom tiles built by Open Plan with Development Seed’s TileMill, hosted by their Mapbox service.

  - section-title: Implementation
    section-description: |
      ThinkShout chose Pantheon to host the site, which would allow for the quick delivery of all that content. It was a visual-heavy project, which called for a host that could handle the data and deliver a smooth user experience without sacrificing speed or reliability.
