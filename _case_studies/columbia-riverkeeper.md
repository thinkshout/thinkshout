  title: "Navigating the waters of Bene"


cs-intro:
  - intro-paragraph: |
      Columbia Riverkeeper’s mission is to protect and restore the water quality of the Columbia River and all life connected to it, from the headwaters to the Pacific Ocean.

  - intro-title: Challenge
    intro-text: |
      Columbia Riverkeeper’s website lacked intuitive navigation, and no longer reflected the organization’s brand. They needed a site that would allow users to easily find the information they were looking for, increase donations, and was easier to manage, performant, and secure.

  - intro-title: Solution
    intro-text: |
      Like many nonprofits, Columbia Riverkeeper has a modest staff and limited budget. We were excited to help them tackle the task of building a new website on the Drupal distribution we released last fall, <a href="https://thinkshout.com/bene/">Bene</a>.

      “ThinkShout's BENE platform is a forward-thinking solution designed to make the daunting task of building a website, a fun and enjoyable experience. Thanks to ThinkShout's team, no matter how complex the design request seems, the BENE platform delivers a thoughtful, well-designed solution.”

    section-title: The Goals
    section-description: |
      Columbia Riverkeeper needed more than just a platform to build a site on, they needed strategy and design support to help them craft clean visuals, simplified messaging, and clear calls to action throughout the website. They required the discovery process, strategy, and design that comes with a high budget website redesign, but they needed it for a fraction of the cost.

      ThinkShout developed <a href="https://thinkshout.com/bene/">Bene</a> precisely to address this scenario.

    section-title: Why Bene
    section-description: |
      <a href="https://thinkshout.com/bene/">Bene</a> is built on Drupal, the leading open source web platform which allows for expansion and customization to meet an organization’s evolving needs. As improvements, integrations, and contributions are made to Bene, those enhancements become available to anyone on the platform. That’s the beauty of open source.

      And, since <a href="https://thinkshout.com/bene/">Bene</a> is templated and built on a specific set of blocks, ThinkShout is able to focus our work with smaller organizations on strategy, design, and customization. Precisely what Columbia Riverkeeper needed.

    section-title: Bene & Columbia Riverkeeper
    section-description: |
      All ThinkShout website redesign projects start with a discovery workshop to assess the client goals and audience motivations -- Bene projects are no different. Our experienced staff worked with Columbia Riverkeeper to define and prioritize their target audiences, their motivations, and how to structure content on their site to keep those audiences coming back and engaged.

      After the onsite, we reviewed any and all assets the client had to help guide our creative direction and set their style tiles.

      We’re still working closely with Columbia Riverkeeper, providing support in the form of security updates, addressing bug fixes as they arise, and quarterly strategic planning sessions.

      Our goal in all of this was to set our partners up in a successful way to achieve maximum impact with their missions. We’re excited to see where they go as they embark upon this new chapter in their digital identity.
