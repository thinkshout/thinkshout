cs-intro:
  - intro-paragraph: |
      Every day, it can feel like our democracy is threatened. We desperately need organizations [like the dynamic “think-and-do” tank—Dēmos](https://www.demos.org/)—to lead us toward a just, inclusive, multiracial democracy.

  - intro-title: Challenge
    intro-text: |
      Rather than being a powerful tool to advance their mission, the aging, unresponsive Dēmos.org more often left visitors feeling confused and uncertain about Dēmos’s incredible work and impact.

  - intro-title: Solutions
    intro-text: |
      The new [Dēmos.org](https://www.demos.org/) is optimized to guide visitors through clear user pathways that help them understand Dēmos’s core issues. We paired a dramatically-simplified information architecture and content structure with gorgeous, people-first design to create an impactful experience that educates, inspires, and motivates visitors to action.

  - section-title: "We established a strong website strategy from the start, 100% aligned with their mission and branding goals."
    section-description: |
      Our Discovery was broad and comprehensive, including a full-day onsite workshop, and review of internal stakeholder research and user personas. It became clear that Dēmos’s work is complex, nuanced, and often driven by current events, media coverage, and public attention.

      The old site was a difficult-to-navigate index of overly-parsed content. However one thing rose above the rest, and that was their core was unwavering: advancing democratic reform and economic justice through a race-forward lens. By building the new website around these essential truths about their organization, we were able to not only set a foundation upon which the rest of the site was constructed, but upon which they could organize their great library of content for users to easily find and quickly grasp.

  - section-title: "We created new and improved content types that better advance their core efforts, including defending cases and publishing innovative research and policy."
    section-description: |
      Publications and cases are at the heart of Dēmos’s work. However, publications on the old Dēmos.org were overly academic, lengthy, and difficult to understand — and cases didn’t even exist anywhere on the site at all. We created new content types that not only bring these efforts visibly into the [new website experience](https://www.demos.org/), but also set structures to make them more accessible to all visitors, with a focus on plain-language, short introductions and table of contents capabilities to allow users to navigate the rich information they contain in an easier, more efficient way.

  - section-title: "We developed stunning and distinct designs to help Dēmos further establish its brand identity."
    section-description: |
      While Dēmos was undertaking holistic brand identity work, we partnered with them to design a website with a refreshed visual identity that elevated their brand from a simple color palette and wordmark to a whole new level of branding.

  - section-title: "A website built on an organization’s “Essential Truths” is a website built to last."
    section-description: |
      Progressive organizations are always working in an extraordinary number of ways to advance the cause they care about, and Dēmos is no different. But regardless of what comes and goes in the media spotlight, or public narrative, a website that is founded upon an organization’s “essential truths” holds steady through it all. You become better positioned to not just weather whatever comes, but harness the momentum and use it to your mission’s and brand’s advantage. With a [new cutting-edge website](https://www.demos.org/) founded upon the fundamentals reasons why the organization exists, we can’t wait to see what Dēmos does next.
