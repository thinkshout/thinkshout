    Families USA helps citizens understand health care options and get their families insured. The organization came to us looking for new website that would serve as the go-to resource for people seeking the most up-to-date information regarding the health care debate and coverage options. Our graphic redesign shifted the website's visual focus from beltway politics to the everyday people needing insurance. We integrated their website with Salsa and Salesforce to engage citizen advocates passionate about affordable and accessible health care.

    Through the discovery process, we learned that public policy makers were a key target audience, and that they needed to be able to quickly access and digest a large volume of content developed by Families USA's expert staff. This led us to the development of a comprehensive tagging system and robust research library interface.

    While the website needed to be a powerful research tool, we also encouraged Families USA to invest in a compelling design that would reflect the citizens at the heart of the health care debate.

    We developed the new Families USA website in Drupal. Access control on the new site is managed through a seamless integration with the organization's new Salesforce instance, which was developed by our partners at Idealist Consulting. The research library is powered by [Apache Solr](https://lucene.apache.org/solr/), allowing site visitors to do keyword searches across the content of many hundreds of PDF documents. All of these powerful features are wrapped into a beautiful, mobile-friendly website design.

    The new Families USA website launched at the beginning of March 2014. Within the first few weeks, the organization quickly noticed a boost in website participation among its target audiences and stakeholders. Capturing the attention of website visitors seeking very specific information on the health care debate, the site encourages them to take action and engage through the organization's online advocacy tools.
