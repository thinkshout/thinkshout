      An interactive case study featuring video, animation, illustration, and deep packets of information for builders.

  - intro-title: Results
    intro-text: |
      The Carbon12 case study has been called the “seminal piece on mass timber building” and is the centerpiece of a year-long influence campaign at conferences and webinars. It was also presented to dozens of homebuilders and architects during The Mass Timber Conference, and was nominated for a Webby in 2020.

      #### A Sustainable Building Alternative

      Building with mass timber products, and specifically cross-laminated timber (CLT), could play a major role in reducing carbon emissions from construction in the United States, yet we are well behind many European countries in our knowledge, policy, and planning. In partnership with the design/build firm responsible for the tallest CLT building in the US, ThinkShout developed an interactive website to "open source" the process in a way that other builders could easily adopt, and which will help build a groundswell of support from residential and financial audiences as well.

      #### From Proprietary Process to Shared Knowledge

      [BuildingCarbon12.com](https://buildingcarbon12.com/) is a multi-chapter interactive story that unfolds around video, animations, pockets of deep information, and an arc that carries visitors from a basic understanding of mass timber products to a bold vision for the future of our cities. By sharing every proprietary detail of their process, our partners at Kaiser + Path have put shared knowledge above business advantage. In fact, their goal is not to corner the market on CLT, but rather to show how feasible — and indeed, necessary — it is to build with sustainable wood products instead of concrete and steel.

      #### Encouraging a sustainable future

      The Carbon12 case study website is the central product of a year-long public relations push to encourage building with mass timber. The USDA Forest Service and Kaiser + Path are working closely to spark development in 2020 and beyond, including the development of two webinars during the annual Mass Timber Conference in Portland, Oregon. The site immediately won the praise of industry leaders, one of whom called it "the seminal piece on mass timber building" when it launched in January. Over the coming months, the site will be leveraged to secure investment in future CLT projects and by architectural firms across the US as they undertake their first mass timber projects.

      “Kaiser + Path is thrilled with the results of our interactive case study. Building Carbon12 has increased awareness and conversation about building with CLT, and our staff is able to refer people across industries to it to get the information they are seeking. It also meets the goals of our partner, USDA Forest Service, who generously funded the project and shares our passion for using wood sustainably.”
