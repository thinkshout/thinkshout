    When we first started talk with the World Wildlife Fund, it was clear that they had a problem - a big - problem. They were sitting on a mountain of sensitive data without a way to sort or report on their findings. The WWF already had a Drupal infrastructure in place, but there was no pre-existing Drupal application out there that could handle their complex needs. So we built them one. While we canâ€™t share the outcomes given the sensitive nature of the data, the work we did now impacts their decision-making process in the realm of fish conversation.

      There was no tool out there yet that could handle the scope of what needed to be accomplished. ThinkShout identified this issue and rectified it by building a brand new Drupal-based application that sorted their data according to more precise criteria and allowed for detailed, in-depth reporting.

    section-description: |
      We worked closely with WWF to define their data input system and the types of reports they needed to produce, which meant that we needed to come up with a means for them to sort their data in a way that would be conducive to reporting. With the data sorted, we were able to introduce a reporting process and matching algorithm that was not only accurate, but also easy for their staff to use.

      The end-result was a highly confidential database that provided the WWF staff with the means to pull the information they sorely needed to make informed programmatic decisions.
