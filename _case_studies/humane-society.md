cs-intro:
  - intro-paragraph: |
      The Humane Society of the United States isn’t your local humane society or pet adoption center. Their mission is to end all forms of animal cruelty. From puppy mills to animal testing, and from trophy hunting to horse slaughter, they take on powerful forces like multibillion dollar industries and systemic governmental policies to bring about a more humane society for us all.

  - intro-title: Challenge
    intro-text: |
      The Humane Society fights so many big fights, across issue areas and 50 states. With such important but complex work, people were struggling to connect with the mission, and the website was suffering from an overload of content.

  - intro-title: Solutions
    intro-text: |
      We launched a stunning new website based in extensive user research that brought their new brand direction to life, streamlined and focused the content, and gave the Humane Society their first truly-custom site complete with features and functionality tailored to meet their big goals.

  - intro-title: Solution
    intro-text: |
      The new website is already providing value to the Humane Society’s rebranding efforts. As the organization’s single-most important brand touchpoint, it is clear from site analytics that visitors are better understanding the mission, engaging with their work at a new level, and looking more into how to get involved.

      Since its founding in 1954, the Humane Society of the United States has fought the fights that only it could fight, taking on powerful forces and root causes that threaten the welfare of animals. The organization works directly to impact policies and systemic animal welfare issues. Their most important goal is to prevent animals from getting into situations of distress in the first place. They drive transformational change for animals—bringing a wide set of tools to take on the biggest fights, confronting multibillion dollar industries and staying the course until they achieve reform.

  - section-title: The Power of Simplicity
    section-description: |
      The Humane Society of the United States does so much important work, across so many issues and in so many places, that the brand position had become overly complex. People were having trouble connecting with the organization, and the existing website suffered from an encyclopedic approach that wasn’t working for supporters, staff, or the general public.

      Through our discovery and content audit of the site, we found that much of the existing traffic to humanesociety.org came from people searching for tips, tricks, and resources for treating animals more humanely. And so one of our early insights was born: people start their journey with The Humane Society of the United States through the a love of one animal, and by connecting them with the underlying issue, we invite them to participate in a larger story.

  - section-title: Invitation to Act
    section-description: |
      The decision to place organizational emphasis on big fights opened the door for making every piece of content actionable. Going into the redesign, we heard from constituents that The HSUS did incredible work, but that often the work was done in isolation. They wanted an invitation to be part of the success story and take action alongside the organization.

      In connecting all content to a big fight — and by surfacing low-lift actions associated with each of those fights — we brought every site visit to within a single click of action. Now, no matter whether a visitor comes from a search, an email, or a banner ad, they have an immediate way to make a difference and join the movement.

  - section-title: Opening Up
    section-description: |
      Supporters were asking for richer content around The HSUS’s daily work, and the results of that work. We found that there were so many stories happening that weren’t reaching the audiences that wanted to hear them. The long-tail process meant results sometimes came months after the call to action was made.

      We embraced the fact that these are long, difficult fights, and they aren’t going to get solved overnight. But when progress is made on policies or the needle moves in favor of these big fights, it will be easier for people to know it and see it surfaced on the site.

    section-title: Toward a More Humane Society
    section-description: |
      Our journey began by examining the data and connecting with real users to learn how visitors experienced the HSUS website. Armed with new insight, we developed a bold, story-driven, action-packed site that elevates the organization’s new brand. Along with our friends at the Humane Society (and our animal friends around the world), we look forward to engaging a whole new generation of HSUS supporters and creating opportunities for any visitor to become a hero the instant they are inspired to take action.
