      The key to Travel Portland’s award-winning website is a deceptively simple design that’s flexible enough to contain a world of content while remaining easy to navigate. Among the industry-leading features is an account-free way to build and share a trip itinerary, called MyTrip. By appending each unique point of interest, article, and event to the Trip, we allow visitors to enjoy a personalized experience without having to add yet another password to the mix.
      
      The core of TravelPortland.com is built with WordPress, chosen for the quality of its editorial experience and seamless integration with calendar, social, hotel reservation, and other critical third-party tools. By hosting the site with our partner Pantheon and optimizing the code in every imaginable way, we don’t have to sacrifice image quality or features for speed — a requirement for maintaining Travel Portland’s solid mobile and SEO advantages.

      Our long-term strategy has been to go beyond the planning stage for travelers, providing on-the-ground expertise and encouraging visitors to share their experiences after they head home. It’s been a winning strategy: visitors to Portland in 2016 generated over $5 billion in direct spending, resulted in $245 million in tax revenue, and supported over 36,000 jobs, all of which has increased year-over-year since partnering with ThinkShout.

      We love Portland, so it’s gratifying to see our city named a top destination nationally and internationally by Travel + Leisure, The Telegraph, and International Traveller, to name a few. As an industry leader, however, Travel Portland isn’t satisfied. Advances in personalized content, live chat, enhanced recommendations, and intelligent search are in the pipeline, and they promise to maintain Travel Portland as a leader in destination marketing.
