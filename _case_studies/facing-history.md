    Facing History and Ourselves shares methodologies and resources that help educators teach equality and tolerance to middle school students. Their online teaching library and event registration tools are critical to growing their global reach. We assisted them in a major Drupal redesign, as well as the implementation of the most sophisticated Salesforce integration we have seen.

      Before engaging with us, Facing History had worked with a number of creative partners and technology providers. Our engineering recommendations began with a thorough review and prioritization of features across many hundreds of pages of documentation. We consolidated this information to map out the development of a responsively-designed publishing platform that leverages a "modular" (or reusable) content model.

      Facing History serves a network of over 100,000 educators and supporters who actively engage through their website. We developed a robust integration that syncs over 280,000 constituent records between Drupal and Salesforce in real time. The solution supports paid event registration, online donations, and a user account access control.

      Having invested over 3,000 hours in the initial website relaunch, we have provided Facing History with a "best of class" solution that will scale with the organization over time.
