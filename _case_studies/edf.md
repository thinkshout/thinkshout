    Through science and economics, the Environmental Defense Fund's Fisheries Program advocates for seafood preservation and conscientious consumption. A vital component of this program is its Seafood Selector App, a mobile website providing shoppers with advice on healthy and eco-friendly seafood options. We worked with EDF's internal development team to redesign the user experience for the Seafood Selector. This couldn't have been a more exciting opportunity for us, given our staff's collective background in environmental conservation.

      In collaboration with EDF staff, we interviewed a sampling of the application's target audience. We then examined website analytics to identify usage patterns and establish performance metrics. Finally, we developed "user stories" to guide the content and information architecture choices for the redesign.

      We developed clickable wireframes that performed beautifully on a variety of mobile and tablet devices. Our mobile-first approach ensured that busy website visitors accessing the Seafood Selector on the go would get the most important information about seafood choices quickly and easily.

      After creating style tiles and a creative brief, we successfully handed off our discovery and design assets to EDF's internal development team, who then rebuilt the responsive website in Drupal 7. The result was a highly interactive, easy-to-use web app that informs consumers about the economic and environmental impacts of their seafood choices.
