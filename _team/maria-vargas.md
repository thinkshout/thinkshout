bio: |
  Maria’s path to ThinkShout is impressive: She studied Criminal Justice and Spanish as an undergrad at Western Oregon University, then went on to grad school at the University of Southern California to study Social Entrepreneurship. Her learning didn’t end there -- she did extensive service-learning in Panama, Honduras, Nicaragua; worked in youth development and leadership programming; specifically targeting at-risk youth increasing academic success and building bridges between schools, communities, and families. She’s also worked with women empowerment programming focused on building safe and motivating spaces for women of color.

  Maria says she loves project management because it allows her to work with many people and allows her to constantly see results. Her experiences, as‌ ‌well‌ ‌as‌ ‌her‌ ‌innate‌ ‌desire‌ ‌to‌ ‌explore‌ ‌and‌ ‌take‌ ‌on‌ ‌new‌ ‌challenges‌ ‌(and‌ ‌view‌ ‌them‌ ‌as‌ ‌adventures), will definitely serve her well on our project management team!
