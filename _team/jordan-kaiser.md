bio: |
  Jordan attended the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and received a BFA in digital graphic design. While there, Jordan interned at an advertising agency that eventually turned into a full time job; it's here where he gained his first experiences in all things digital. He’s worked for clients across sectors doing digital strategy, website design, and frontend and backend development–from complex medical institutions like MemorialCare to manufacturers like E-Z-GO.
  <p>Outside of work, Jordan enjoys chemistry–but not in the traditional sense. He brews small batches of kombucha and pickles things, and is currently expanding his pickling horizons by way of radishes, beets and even eggs!
