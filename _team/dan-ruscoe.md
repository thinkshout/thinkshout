  Dan is an enthusiastic proponent of open source software and maintains a number of open source projects. After four years writing software for social games and ad platforms in Los Angeles, he got tired of the constant sunshine and joined ThinkShout in Portland to see what all this rain is about.

bio: |
  Given his expertise in building social gaming platforms, he has a strong sense for how web technologies can be used to promote web engagement. Dan left California in search of an opportunity to contribute regularly to the open source community and put those contributions to good use for nonprofits. He studied Computing, Electronics and Physics at Bolton Sixth Form College in Bolton, England. When he isn’t writing code, he’s normally hacking away at an electronics project or engrossed in a point-and-click adventure game. While he loves new technology, he still keeps a couple of long-obsolete computers around as a reminder of where he started programming.
