  Greg is the only member of our team (maybe the only person we know) who doesn’t own a smartphone. Oddly enough, he’s still on the cutting edge of open source technology.

bio: |
  Greg got his start in web development as a young entrepreneur, focusing on web consulting, hosting, and product development. He has a Master’s degree in Information Technology Management and is an active volunteer and speaker in the Portland Drupal community. Greg has led the development of numerous, large-scale Drupal web applications, yet he considers his greatest achievement to be his open source contributions to Drupal 8. When he’s not speaking at local Drupal events, or helping nonprofits leverage new technologies, he’s trying to convince himself that he likes chamomile tea. 120 cups in and he’s still not sure if it’ll ever be a taste he acquires. He’s also an avid bicyclist and especially enjoys riding through Portland’s very rare, freak blizzards.
