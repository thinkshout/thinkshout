  With a natural affinity for establishing operations procedures and a love for tech firms, Krista couldn’t feel more at home as at ThinkShout. She loves solving complex organizational problems, almost as much as she loves her chickens.

bio: |
  Krista’s forte is setting up effective processes that improve our day-to-day operations. She excels at supporting organizations, streamlining the daily complexities that take place behind the scenes. Before finding her way to ThinkShout, she spent some time in California - long enough to decide that all that sun just wasn’t for her. After returning to rainy Portland, she worked as the Office Manager at Metal Toad. Krista studied psychology, business, and education (just for fun) at Western Oregon University. When she’s not busy keeping all of our ducks in a row, she’s tending to her urban farm, raising chickens and growing her own food. She plans to expand her livestock collection to eventually include goats and pheasants. We’re considering implementing a Bring Your Goat to Work Day in the office.
