bio: |
  As the Systems Administrator at Ecotrust & The Wild Salmon Center, Gabe gained a deep knowledge of nonprofit technology needs and challenges, solved technical problems of many stripes, and gained a deep understanding of nonprofit culture. As the Operations Director for Immigration Equality, he helped a small non-profit grow from 7 to 17 employees, open an office in DC, form an Action Fund to lobby for political change, and built a unified database for tracking the organizationâ€™s constituents, contributions, and legal clients.
  <p>Gabe has a BA in Computer Science and Theatre from Oberlin College. Those seemingly isolated subjects describe his approach to building great technology solutions: collaboration in pursuit of a shared goal requires communication and understanding. Only with that understanding can we build successful software.
