  Eric doesn’t shy away from large scale technical undertakings. His experience as a designer and front end developer, as well as his love of open source, make him a great asset to the team. He’s also a self-proclaimed music nerd with a pretty serious vinyl record collection.

bio: |
  Eric joined us because he wanted to be part of a team that valued open source contributions and meaningful projects as much as he does. From discovery to implementation, he remains committed to delivering technical work of the highest caliber. His background in web and mobile application development gave him the foundation needed for a major undertaking with the State of Oregon, where he led the design and front end development of the relaunch of Oregon.gov. In his spare time, he geeks out over music and hunts down new additions to his record collection. He also ran the St. Jude Marathon...once. Once was enough.
