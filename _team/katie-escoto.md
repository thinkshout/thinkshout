bio: |
  Katie comes to ThinkShout as a graduate from Cornell University, where she studied engineering before starting a tech job at Barclays Investment Bank. After Barclays, Katie wanted to learn more about the process side of her work, so she spent years in various non-technical roles in the fintech sector — from business continuity to project management (all while being involved in her companies’ DEI and CSR efforts).  
  <p>These experiences not only gave Katie a myriad of skills, but they also turned something that had been a budding thought into a necessary action: a career shift that could combine her love of tech and process with her passion for social good. In pursuit of this, Katie attended the Grace Hopper Program at Fullstack Academy in tandem with an MPA program at CUNY Baruch, ultimately reskilling herself as a software engineer/public management extraordinaire.  
  <p>When Katie’s not using her perfect blend of people skills and project management savvy to deliver excellent technical experiences, you can find her making comedy, baking, singing karaoke, or completing Ironman races. (No big deal!!) Katie also has a corgi named Phoebe, which we think is extremely important information.
