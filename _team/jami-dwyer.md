  Once, Jami was paid to build an Internet-enabled machine that blew bubbles in response to specific tweets. We don’t have her working on anything nearly as world-changing as that project, but as a software engineer at ThinkShout, Jami specializes in helping nonprofits turn large datasets into information.

bio: |
  Jami began her professional life as a bench chemist. So far, we have been unsuccessful in getting her to wear a lab coat and goggles at the office. While working in a biological research lab, Jami learned PHP and MySQL to build analytical tools to assist her team. Now, she’s putting her skills to use for our nonprofit customers, primarily developing Drupal websites. When she’s not helping our clients or contributing to open source projects, she’s watching “Frozen” for the umpteenth time, perfecting her own rendition of “Let it Go.”
