bio: |
  <p>Sabriya has always marveled at the power of marketing, design and strategy. As a Michael Jordan fan, she had an aha moment, puzzled over the obsession of Nike Air Jordan's. "If campaigns can get urban teens to worship Jordans, imagine the causes I can get others to care about." Now, Sabriya is a marketing strategist, entrepreneur, and travel enthusiast. With diverse private and public sector experience, she has led many global campaigns.   
  <p>Sabriya began her career at the American Heart Association, working as a marketing specialist supporting heart health awareness campaigns and regional fundraising initiatives. After completing her graduate studies, Sabriya discovered the fintech industry—a surprising contrast from the non-profit sector. For ten years, she led marketing strategies for Broadridge and Fidessa, launching new products, growing client retention, improving systems, and optimizing data analysis tools.   
  <p>Sabriya has served as a consultant for various industries—including health, entertainment, non-profits, and startups. She has a love for entrepreneurial incubators that drive investment in economically underserved markets; she’s worked with MEST, an incubator in Accra, Ghana and Flavors Culinary Group, a culinary incubator in Maryland. She manages projects from concept to execution with cross-functional teams, emphasizing user-centered data, collaboration, and experimentation.  
  <p>Sabriya is an arts supporter and former board member of Dwana Smallwood Performing Arts Center and an Americore V.I.S.T.A. alum. She received a B.A. in Communications from the University of Maryland College Park and an M.A. in Media Studies, Marketing Management from New School University.     
  <p>When she's not working, she’s experimenting with a new vegetarian recipe, brainstorming with a startup, or enjoying a local river or beach destination with family and friends.
