  Being a tech genius runs in Rebecca’s family. Inspired by web development from a young age, she still gets a thrill every time she sees the front end of code.

bio: |
  Rebecca is constantly hungry for knowledge, and feels most fulfilled when she’s not only able to learn, but when she’s able to use her extensive tech expertise to teach others and form meaningful, human connections. It makes sense, then, why Rebecca chose to combine her passion for coding with her love of the nonprofit world-- focusing not only on web development, but the communities these organizations served. Her passion for nonprofit work was fueled by the first thing Rebecca built with code: a website for a non-profit that tutored LatinX children to help them learn English. Ever since, Rebecca landed developing jobs with mission driven organizations; from redesigning websites in higher education, to a web development role with Food & Water Watch (an environmental non-profit).

  Don’t be fooled to think Rebecca only focuses on her (very impressive) work. She is also an avid activist for social and environmental issues; she spent years volunteering for an environmental non-profit doing outreach to the LatinX community in Texas in order to ban fracking. (Yeah. Be impressed-- we sure are!) When Rebecca isn’t busy making computer coding magic or fighting for change, she’s an avid long distance runner, nature enthusiast, and film photographer.
