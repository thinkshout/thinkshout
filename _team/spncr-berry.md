bio: |
  Spncr had been intimidated by the complexity of development from a young age, so they set out to build the skills they needed little by little—from practicing by route of video game development and WordPress site support, to years of intense self study. Eventually, Spncr’s technical knowledge along with their drive to align their daily work with organizations that bring about positive change landed them here at ThinkShout. 
  <p>Spncr’s path to web development was not linear; they twisted and turned and explored work that embraced their inclination to creativity and passion for making. With a degree in filmmaking from Academy of Art University in San Francisco, Spncr wrote and directed films before moving on to other jobs—some of which included working in sales, recruiting technologists, and even working in the technology side of a cabinet factory. 
  <p>Spncr’s professional talents are equally translated into their many hobbies. Whether it be yo-yo making, cooking, solving puzzles, or being named the Finnish National Kendama champion, it’s clear that Spncr sits at the junction of logic, creativity, and problem solving.
