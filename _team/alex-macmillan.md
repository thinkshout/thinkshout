bio: |
  Prior to ThinkShout, Alex spent several years as a project manager in the healthcare industry, overseeing several large web development projects centered around providing the public with health care resources online. Through this work, she learned the power of the Internet as a tool for making social change. Alex studied psychology at University of Oregon, specifically empathy, motivation, and decision-making. Her insight into the human thought process allows her to evaluate problems from multiple viewpoints. When Alex isn’t managing the many moving pieces that make ThinkShout tick, she’s at her house, playing the never-ending game of home improvement.
