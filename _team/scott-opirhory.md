bio: |
  <p>Though Scott began his love of art and design at the age of 10, he was formally introduced to the digital era when he enrolled in 'Designing Information Tools' while studying Industrial design at RISD. Quickly hooked to the world of web design, Scott began his career freelancing as a designer and art director for small businesses, artists, musicians, and record labels. 
  <p>
Scott landed his first agency role at Silverpoint—a service provider for elite private and international schools—where he was able to hone his craft designing websites around the globe. In 2015, Scott moved on to join Fastspot, where he began working with prominent higher education and cultural institutions such as Yale University, Georgetown Law, and The Chicago Council for Global Affairs. Here, Scott supported and led teams that resulted in numerous award-winning sites. He also grew his skillset to include mentorship, UX, brand stewardship, motion prototyping, accessible design, and design systems. Now, Scott is excited to bring his background and enthusiasm for design to ThinkShout because of its mission-driven values. 
  <p>In his spare time, Scott is an avid music listener, Italian-American cook, and artist. Between 2010-2019 he shot, designed and self-published, 'Fair Lawn'—a photo book that explored his personal history through observing his mothers' role as a caretaker for his grandmother. He also loves long-distance endurance trekking, exploring remote areas such as Laugavegur, The Dolomites, and Torres del Paine.
