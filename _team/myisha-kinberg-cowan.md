  <p><strong>Favorite Planet:</strong> It’s not really a planet anymore, but Pluto. I like that it’s cold and dark, and it’s so small. I actually don’t know why I like those things about it.</p>
  <p><strong>Dream Trip:</strong> Japan. I have a lot on my list, but that’s one that’s the most unique. I’d love to take a solo trip to Tokyo.</p>
