bio: |
  Sean's goal in co-founding ThinkShout was to make life easier on his colleagues in the nonprofit sector who were responsible for advocacy campaigns. He brings over twelve years of diverse leadership and technical consulting experience to the team. He has been working with the best and brightest software engineers and designers in the Drupal community for the past eight years. He has led national community organizing initiatives and international relief projects, served as a fundraising strategist for environmental groups worldwide, and ran two open source software consultancies specializing in Drupal development. He holds a masters of public administration (MPA) degree from Syracuse University's Maxwell School. When not in the office, Sean is either fishing on a Northwest stream or at the gym training Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.
