  Mike’s got a strong knack for the technical details and is accomplished at spearheading digital initiatives for large nonprofits. He has all the traits of an expert cat-herder. And he's apparently never tweeted a day in his life. Too busy managing the nitty-gritty, we assume.

bio: |
  Mike's experience ranges from serving small grassroots nonprofits to large broadcasting organizations. He was heavily involved in the web design and information architecture of some of Boston’s WGBH popular digital programming, such as American Experience and NOVA. Mike joined the ThinkShout team so that he could continue his work with socially responsible organizations, and he brings a wealth of technical project management experience with him. While he’s got a number of project-related accomplishments under his belt, he says he’s most proud of being a father of three girls who’d rather be fairies and demons than Disney princesses. When he’s not wrangling his kids, he’s enjoying outdoor sports like fly fishing and windsurfing.
