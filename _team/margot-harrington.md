bio: |
  Margot got their start as a brand and packaging designer in 2008. Since then, their path has criss-crossed through a variety of spaces in and out of the tech world—content strategy, art direction, ecommerce design, retail merchandising, interior design, and art with non-profits, mission-based businesses, and creative organizations. Margot has even gained experience in higher ed as an Adjunct Professor in the web design department at DePaul University in Chicago.  
  <p>Outside of work, you can find Margot doing *all* of the things. A detailed—but non-exhaustive list—includes: rollerskating, painting, printmaking, making awesome gluten-free food, mushroom hunting, dancing, traveling, hanging out with their friends and, equally important, hanging out with their friends’ pets.
