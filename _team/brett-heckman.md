  Brett creates memorable and engaging web experiences. He is a talented designer and information architect with a knack for turning complex concepts into beautiful digital stories. But we really hired him because we love his two dogs, Gus and Waylon.

bio: |
  Before ThinkShout, Brett was a production director at Wardenclyffe, a design agency based in New York City. There, he worked with high-end fashion and entertainment brands, but his appreciation for mission-based organizations ultimately led him to our team.  Here, he utilizes his talents for worthy causes, bringing that same standard of great design to our client work. Brett also worked at OpenSourcery as a front end developer, where he honed his skills with front end technologies such as javascript and HTML5. At home, Brett is usually banging around in the kitchen, building something.
