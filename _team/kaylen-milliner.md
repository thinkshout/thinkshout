bio: |
  <p>Kaylen earned her BA from the University of Pittsburgh where she double-majored in Film Studies and Communications–and while Kaylen might still make a movie (or two) someday–this experience led to roles that spanned a variety of sectors. From content creation and event planning, to website administration and working as an AmeriCorps Public Ally in Cincinnati–Kaylen’s breadth of experience ultimately guided her to project management, where she finds a specific passion working for organizations that make direct, social impact. She is very proud of her work to refine and rebrand member communications for a retail labor union, as well as her most recent work with process improvement as a project manager at an advertising company. Kaylen is passionate about K-12 media and digital literacy education and hopes to make an impact in this area in the future.
  <p>When Kaylen isn’t working, she’s usually running around town with her family or planning her next trip. And, while she hasn’t had a ton of time for hobbies, she’s excited to explore new ventures like podcasting and playing the guitar.
