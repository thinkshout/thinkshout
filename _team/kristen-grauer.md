bio: |
  <p>Kristen's love of systems strengthening budded as a student in Valparaiso, Chile where she studied collective memory, collective action, and democracy after dictatorship. Her passion blossomed in Washington, D.C. where she worked for the Results for Development Institute, building a digital network for some of the world’s most innovative and remote educators to share best practices. She spent the next decade championing communications strategies for nonprofits of varying sizes and scopes - advancing global causes like increasing access to renewable energy in Latin America, and local causes like breaking barriers for immigrants to enter the workforce in Portland, Oregon. Most recently, she served as Development Manager at the nonprofit, Health In Harmony, executing data-driven marketing campaigns and building relationships with high-level donors to protect rainforests in Indonesia, Madagascar, and Brazil by meeting the self-identified needs of rainforest communities, like healthcare. 
  <p>When she’s not working, Kristen can be found in the kitchen trying new recipes with her husband, at the park playing ball with her scruffy dog, Jeffrey, and spending time outdoors walking, hiking, kayaking, and camping.
