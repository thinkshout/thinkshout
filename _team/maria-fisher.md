 Maria’s always had a knack for solving puzzles, and we think websites are basically puzzles, so she's good at those, too. She’s also pretty excited about all things open source. Who doesn't love free technology?

bio: |
  It’s that passion for the open source world that drew Maria to ThinkShout, and she loves that she gets to spend time contributing back to the Drupal community as part of her day job. Maria’s foray into software engineering began in college with her degree in computer science. Since then, she's experienced her fair share massive data migrations, site building, and everything in between. She’s tackled innumerable challenges, but none so terrifying as presenting to 9 year-olds about what it’s like to be a programmer. When she’s not giving career advice to small humans, Maria can usually be found crafting, or playing board games with friends.
