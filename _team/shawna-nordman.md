bio: |
  <p>Shawna has been an actor since she was 10 years old, so it makes sense that she eventually  received her BA in Theater Performance from Whitworth University. After graduation, Shawna worked as an actor and Marketing/PR Director for a small ensemble company before moving on to jobs in customer service, internal communications, order fulfillment, and project management. 
  <p>Out of all Shawna’s experiences, project management was what she enjoyed most, so she completed a certificate program at Oregon State University and became a Project Manager for Bolt Threads, a materials innovation company. While there, Shawna worked on every type of marketing effort imaginable–she even produced a TED Talk from start to finish, from supporting the development of content and visuals to managing the execution of a post-talk publication strategy. Now with ThinkShout, Shawna is all about tapping into her natural ability to organize and execute to help teams shine.
  <p>Outside of work, Shawns loves all things food–from trying new restaurants to revisiting old favorites. She’s also a die-hard women’s soccer fan and love’s cheering on the Portland Thorns.
