bio: |
  <p>Julie has always enjoyed making art, but it wasn’t until college that she honed in on her practice of graphic and interactive design. It was around this time that Julie began making a lot of socially and politically influenced print and digital pieces–solidifying her understanding of the importance of communication in design. Ever since, Julie's been dedicated to using visual design to amplify the voices of grassroots and nonprofit organizations. 
  <p>Julie graduated from Portland State University with a BS in Graphic Design, specializing in interactive design before returning to PSU to teach digital design courses as an Adjunct Professor of Art and Design. Julie then shifted to more project-forward work in the branding space–leading on projects from both the design and front-end development side. Julie’s built digital products for small to mid-size businesses and non-profits across all industries: art, architecture, health and wellness, cannabis, real estate, education, and food and hospitality.
