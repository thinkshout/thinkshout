bio: |
  Rose, a graduate of Washington State University, came to ThinkShout with an extensive background in nonprofit communications, working at organizations like YWCA Clark County and United Way of the Columbia-Willamette. All of this experience has led her to care deeply about supporting and empowering our clients to do their best work—which she does on the daily. 
  <p>Now a seasoned ThinkShouter, Rose has worked on projects of all sizes and of all complexities. A few projects that Rose is especially proud of are the launch of Lehigh Valley Health Network and their healthcare-driven mission (especially during a pandemic), and supporting Facing History and Ourselves in bringing their seminars for teachers from in-person to offline.
  <p>When she’s not managing projects or working on team support and process improvements, she’s learning about LGBTQIA+ history, re-reading her favorite books, or exploring the beautiful Pacific NW that she calls home.
