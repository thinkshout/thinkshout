bio: |
  Rose came to ThinkShout with an extensive background in nonprofit communications. Having been on the client side of the table, she cares deeply about supporting and empowering our clients to do their best work. She’s worked with a variety of organizations, including Facing History and Ourselves, Lehigh Valley Health Network, Humane Society of the United States, and the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife. She’s worked with nonprofits outside of work too, including co-founding the Bi Brigade, a local LGBTQ support organization.
  <p>When she’s not ensuring that we’re meeting deadlines, she’s listening to history podcasts, re-reading her favorite books, or watching the latest episode of RuPaul’s Drag Race.
