bio: |
  Jules graduated from the University of Oregon with a BA in multimedia, and later received her graphic design BFA from the Art Institute of Portland. She spent the last several years volunteering with Red Sweater Project, helping them rework their entire website to better support their mission to improve the lives of youth in Tanzania. She joined the ThinkShout team so she could put her passion for building things to use helping the organizations committed to positive change. Jules once summited Kilimanjaro while afflicted with food poisoning. If that’s not a lesson in tenacity, then we don’t know what is. Way to tough it out, Jules.
