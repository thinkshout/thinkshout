bio: |
  <p>Cynthia was part of the 90s generation of kids who designed and coded out Geocities websites–complete with flashing marquees and guestbooks. This hobby soon became a career, as Cynthia graduated from Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo with a major in Graphic Design.
  <p>Post-college, Cynthia’s professional experiences were centered on designing and developing end-to-end digital mobile and web experiences, having worked across multiple sectors such as healthcare, academia, travel, and e-commerce. In her design practice, Cynthia especially enjoys working side by side with development teams–leveraging her own development skills to make her designs come to life via code. 
  <p>Outside of work, Cynthia finds creativity in recreating her favorite recipes from childhood, building everyday apps, and learning the violin.
