bio: |
  Sol first became interested in the tech world when he was in high school–after taking a class related to game development, he knew that was what he wanted to be when he grew up. From there, Sol set out to figure out how to code without a computer science degree. So, Sol balanced working as a line cook while teaching himself how to code by way of online tutorials. A lot of hard work later, Sol landed his first web development job at a Magento agency before moving into freelance work. Sol got back into agency life at a WordPress shop before joining the ThinkShout team, where he’s excited to work for clients who are making differences in the world. 
  <p>When Sol isn’t coding, you can find him gaming–from League of Legends, to Magic the Gathering, to Dungeons and Dragons games. Oh, and he’s a hockey fan. Go Avs!
