bio: |
  <p>Monica has been working in strategic communications, online & social media campaigning, and fundraising for almost 20 years. After earning a law degree from Lewis & Clark, she became an advocate for environmental health and justice, gravitating towards e-advocacy, and then spent 7 years as a climate organizer and creative director. During that time, she mobilized health professionals to speak out against new coal plant proposals, developed and maintained the market-based campaign site HealthyStuff.org, and organized community members to take action on climate change. She has organized everything from green home bike tours and garden challenges to brand and website redesigns.    
  <p>Now, in addition to her strategy and project management work, Monica is finding both growth and balance by nourishing her inner leader; she recently completed 200 practice coaching hours after becoming certified from Leadership that Works.   
  <p>When Monica has time to herself, she enjoys tending to her house plants, stretching, letter writing, and trying out *more* hobbies.
