bio: |
  Daniel majored in Informatics at the University of Washington. He’s spent much of his career focused on analytics, but he eventually changed gears and discovered a passion for engineering. Daniel participated in our very first summer internship program in 2015. After his internship concluded, he joined another agency, where he worked on the back end of a major e-learning implementation for a Portland-based veterinary company. When it came time to move on to the next adventure, Daniel looked to ThinkShout for an opportunity to work with socially-conscious clients. Naturally, we were thrilled to have him back. Daniel has a tremendous sense of adventure, so when he’s not enjoying the safety of his computer, he’s probably off on a motorcycle journey across distant lands.
