  Kaylan has always been really gratified by a well executed plan and a completed to-do list. Add some strategic communications, creative problem solving, and team leadership and project management is really a perfect fit - so much so that Kaylan earned her PMP (Project Management Professional) certification a few years back.

bio: |
  Kaylan has spent the last decade in the world of EdTech, SaaS, and digital organizations, working on program/project implementations and client success initiatives - including training and process improvement. She has a Master's degree in English literature and is a self-proclaimed research nut. Kaylan’s past volunteer efforts have run the gamut of supporting early literacy to serving as a whale watch naturalist and tour guide. These days she volunteers as an activist with Family Forward Oregon, lobbying on issues that impact women’s economic security such as paid family leave and affordable, quality childcare. But when it’s time to relax, there’s nothing Kaylan enjoys more than exploring family-friendly wineries throughout the Willamette Valley with her husband and toddler.
