  Kaylan is a natural storyteller and problem-solver. She genuinely loves the nature of project management and few things are quite as satisfying to her as seeing our clients’ projects to completion. That love is only rivaled by her passion for fairy tales - the scary kind.

bio: |
  Before joining ThinkShout, Kaylan managed projects in a wide variety of industries, particularly, education, where she partnered with various universities to design and implement long-term executive coaching programs to increase student retention and engagement.  We love the diversity of her experience and her unwavering enthusiasm for each project she oversees. She has a Master's degree in English literature and is a self-proclaimed research nut. She also really, really loves marine mammals and used to volunteer for the Cabrillo Marine Aquarium in Los Angeles as a whale watch tour guide. She’s the only person in the office who’s toured the Brothers Grimm route in Germany. Spooky.
