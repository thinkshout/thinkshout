bio: |
  Having worked extensively in the nonprofit sector, Stephanie knows all too well that keeping your technology up to date and accessible to your constituents is hard to prioritize when working on a tight budget. She has a BA from Gonzaga University and spent three years in freelance video production and content editing for independent online press. She eventually found herself in the nonprofit world, where she spearheaded a social media campaign and developed a communications plan for Families Forward in Southern California. Through this experience, Stephanie developed a great appreciation for open source tools that help nonprofits better engage their constituents and she continues to be an advocate for nonprofit technology. Unlike Inigo Montoya, Stephanie fences left-handed.
