bio: |
  <p>From helping organize Tri-State Opioid Addiction Symposiums, creating training programs for folks who were previously incarcerated, and advocating for LGBTQIA+ rights, doing work that matters is intrinsically important to Bri. At her core, she believes everything is rooted in building authentic relationships. She credits being an active listener and building trust as essential skills for developing both internal and external partnerships.
  <p>Prior to this role, she served as VP of Strategic Development at both an IT company and a biotechnology company. Bri’s professional origins are rooted in education—she served as Dean at a college, a high school Vice Principal, and an English teacher. Additionally, Bri holds a doctorate from Frostburg State University, a master’s degree from Wilmington University, and a bachelor’s degree from Salisbury University.
  <p>On the weekends, you can find Bri hiking, on the water, or visiting local vineyards and breweries in search of finding the perfect pairing to accompany her cheese appreciation. (Because Bri loves Brie! And *we* love a good pun.)
