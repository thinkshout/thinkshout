  Bob is a people person, and not just because he loves having folks to tell his jokes to. He understands that the foundation for any successful organization is a dedicated team, and having them feel heard is his top priority.

bio: |
  Before ThinkShout, Bob has zig-zagged his way through careers (with bouts of traveling mixed in) based in social and environmental good. A graduate in philosophy from The University of Wisconsin, Bob served two terms as an Americorps volunteer before going to pursue environmental law. Well, almost pursue. Lucky for us, while he was working for a sustainable building organization, an actual environmental lawyer talked him out of it. So Bob pivoted and landed in the digital agency world, where he has gained experience working for an educational software company, Laughing Planet (a fellow B Corp!), and Cerbo, a medical software company where he redesigned and rebuilt their entire Patient Portal. Not a feat for the weak!  
  <p>Believe it or not, Bob is just as impressive outside of the digital support world. You know what they say, “A Bob of all trades is a master of...a lot of other ones as well.” OK, so maybe we made that up, but it holds true because Bob has a bunch of cool hobbies. He loves being active by way of hiking, backpacking, bike riding, gardening, or skydiving-- bonus points if his pup can come along. He has also developed a love and talent for pottery, which he likes to joke is in his blood. (Because his last name is Potter, ha ha, get it?) Finally, lesser known to the Portland community, Bob is a reality TV show star with an appearance on “My First Place.” Please refer to his agent for autographs or booking details.
