bio: |
  Bob, a graduate in philosophy from The University of Wisconsin, served two terms as an Americorps volunteer before going to pursue environmental law. Well, almost pursue. Lucky for us, while he was working for a sustainable building organization, an environmental lawyer talked him out of it. So Bob pivoted and landed in the digital agency world, where he has gained experience working for an educational software company, Laughing Planet (a fellow B Corp), and Cerbo, a medical software company where he redesigned and rebuilt their entire Patient Portal.    
  <p>Outside of work, Bob loves doing pottery, hiking, backpacking, bike riding, and gardening-bonus points if his pup can come along. Bob is also a reality TV show star with an appearance on “My First Place.” Please refer to his agent for autographs or booking details.
