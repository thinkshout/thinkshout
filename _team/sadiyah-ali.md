bio: |
  Sadiyah first became interested in tech when she was in middle school and wanted to start a blog. As a picky child, she didn’t like any of the free themes that the platform offered. So she started researching how to customize the themes to her liking and stumbled onto the world of web development. It was love at first sight. Programming allows her to learn how to approach large and complex problems, grow, and seek innovative solutions.
  <p>Sadiyah has served as the creative director and front-end developer for a local non-profit organization for the past 5 years (Daughters of Eve). There, she built tools that helped the team improve their workflow and allowed them to better serve their target audience. When she’s not focused on leaving a positive impact in the world through coding, she enjoys seasonal activities like hiking, baking, volunteering in her community whenever the opportunity arises.
