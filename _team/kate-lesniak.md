  Digital strategy isn’t just about what we do on our phones. It offers us all a million chances to be more than what we already are—it changes us IRL. I love being someone who shapes those opportunities and opens those doors.

  Before joining ThinkShout, Kate served as publisher at Bitch Media where she implemented an industry-leading engagement model that leveraged the organization's award-winning editorial work towards financial sustainability. She is a frequent speaker on building digital products and engagement models, and is the recipient of an Institute for Nonprofit News innovation grant funded by the Knight Foundation and Democracy Fund to test new membership program strategies. Kate is a member of 2018 Online News Association's Women's Leadership Accelerator and was named one of Media Shift's Top 20 Digital Media Innovators of 2017. For 12 years, Kate's work has centered on the data, systems, and strategies that make us who we are across all digital formats. She has worked as a digital organizer, fundraiser, and strategic program builder with organizations like Democracy for America, Corporate Accountability International, and the Vermont Democratic Party, among others.
  <p>A graduate of the University of Vermont with a BA in Political Science, Sociology, and English, Kate also served as team captain for the Women’s Ice Hockey team and scored the first-ever hat trick in the program’s Division I history. When Kate isn’t opening doors for organizations driving change, she can be found either cross-country skiing with her dog in the winter, swimming in a body of water in the summer, or strolling through her neighborhood with her toddler and a cup of coffee at any time of year.
