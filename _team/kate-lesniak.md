  Digital strategy isn’t just about what we do on our phones. It offers us all a million chances to be more than what we already are—it changes us IRL. I love being someone who shapes those opportunities and opens those doors.

While s he was there, she took them from leading the conversation editorially to leading an industry in engagement, financial sustainability, and editorial strategy. Before joining Bitch Media in 2012, she worked as a digital organizer and fundraiser with Democracy for America, Corporate Accountability International, Vermont Freedom to Marry, and the Vermont Democratic Party, among others.
  <p>A graduate of the University of Vermont with a BA in Political Science, Sociology, and English, she also served as team captain for the Women’s Ice Hockey team and scored the first-ever hat trick in the program’s Division I history.
  <p>When Kate isn’t opening doors for organizations driving change, she can be found either cross-country skiing with her dog in the winter, swimming in a body of water in the summer, or coming up with clever portmanteaus.
