bio: |
  Julia saw in ThinkShout an opportunity to blend her experience in the program side of the nonprofit world with her history of managing large scale events. She loves the A to Z process that big projects require to be successful, and she’s not afraid of  the challenges that may arise on the way - in fact, she welcomes them. She once picked up her entire life and moved to South America to volunteer. If that’s not fearless, then we don’t know what is. Now she’s in her element, managing large budgets, navigating around moving targets, and working to ensure our project deliverables are up to the ThinkShout standard. When she’s not project managing, she’s baking, reading, and traveling.
