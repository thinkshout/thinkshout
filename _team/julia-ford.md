bio: |
  Julia is the rare person who loves the process and much as she loves what’s possible. By that, of course, we mean that Julia is equally a thought partner in visioning and a project manager in execution—the perfect balance for directing our sales and marketing efforts. Surprising? Not to us! But maybe that’s because before she stepped into her current role at ThinkShout, Julia wrangled visions, timelines, and budgets as first a project manager, and then a client experience manager for 3 years, where she led some of our most complicated projects from kickoff to launch to the great satisfaction of our clients.
  <p>Before she joined our team, Julia did everything faster and somewhat more randomly than everyone else: After graduating from college a year early (she says it’s because it was so expensive—and we’ll give her that—but we think it’s just because she’s smart), she served the Portland community as a case manager at Central City Concern, delighted customers as a lead pastry chef, started her own catering and event management company (it still exists, and her cookies are supreme), and worked as a development director at a local school, leveraging relationship management systems and major gifts work to bring education to life.
  <p>When Julia’s not busy (which is never), she can be found baking, swimming, traveling, and practicing her Spanish.
