 Mark has a flare for the dramatic. He once jumped out of a plane and got married during a total solar eclipse (not on the same day).

bio: |
 Mark’s dad introduced him to a fun time-waster called the “World Wide Web” in the early 90s when dial-up modems were all the rage [insert modem sound clip here]. He pretty much hasn’t stopped building websites & applications since.
 He started out building web pages as a freelancer in 2001; and meandered his way from front-end developer, back-end PHP engineer, to full-stack PHP/Ruby/JS developer. Prior to ThinkShout, he managed a diverse set of software engineers that together created an open-source Ruby-on-Rails CMS. While all this is impressive, it’s his dedication to social responsibility that makes him a great fit for ThinkShout. And if all else fails, he has a backup career as an amateur cat psychologist.
