bio: |
  Olivia is a graduate of the University of Vermont with a BS in Community and International Development, and a double minor in Communications and Studio Art. During college, she interned with The Peace and Justice Center, which solidified her desire to work in the nonprofit sector. Post-college, Olivia worked as an Outreach Advocate for a nonprofit sexual and domestic assault crisis center in Vermont. While she was passionate about the work and grew close to the community she served, she was drawn to the importance and creativity of marketing and how it can be leveraged to gain support for a mission. She was excited to join ThinkShout to focus on showcasing the work of a dedicated team who are fueled by the mission driven organizations that they partner with.  
  <p>Outside of work, Olivia enjoys painting, pottery, teaching yoga, and running very, very slowly. She also loves to travel, and challenges herself to visit as many places as she can while spending as little money as possible. Olivia is also obsessed with her pug puppy, Oats, for whom she owns a pug-backpack. Thatâ€™s right. A pug backpack.
