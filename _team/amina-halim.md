bio: |
  From a very young age Amina has had a passion for art and writing, but was encouraged to pursue a career in science. She eventually discovered the potential in merging creativity with science and technology in order to create meaningful change-- and that discovery is precisely what drove her to her role at ThinkShout.  
  <p>Amina comes to ThinkShout as a graduate from UC Berkeley. After starting her professional role handling marketing efforts for nonprofits, Amina was led to pursue a Masters in Advertising. She then grew to work as a global creative on many multinational brands, winning new clients and numerous awards while managing creative teams internationally. And when we say winning awards, we mean winning <em>big awards</em>. Amina impressively won the first Cyber Lion on behalf of the Middle East and North Africa, as well as “Poem of the Year” by the National Society of Poetry. 
  <p>When Amina isn’t creating great things for mission-driven organizations, you can find her cooking, traveling, or writing (she’s a published food and travel writer with articles in international guidebooks and literary magazines-- go figure!). And if you’re <em>really</em> lucky, you might even find her doing standup comedy.
