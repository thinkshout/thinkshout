  Would you move to a country without knowing next to nothing about it? Ben did, when he taught English in Japan for a year. It’s that open-mindedness and willingness to tackle anything that makes him a great at utilizing technology to solve problems for our clients.

bio: |
  Ben hails from Boston and is joining the ranks of our remote employees (which we are rapidly growing!). His journey to the world of web development started with literature -- he loved being able to publish his own material and created his own site to do so. That experience taught him that solving problems with web technology was quite satisfying. He then really got into web development the way we all discover our true passions...via his work-study job. He went on to build an entire tech department at a small shop in Boston, choosing the CMS, training developers, and creating their code standards. His passion for literature was merely transferred to writing code.
  That’s the type of leadership and initiative we like to see at ThinkShout. We’re glad he’s representing us on the east coast!
