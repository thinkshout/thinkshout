  Britt finds true enjoyment in helping others navigate the world’s complexities in order to put inspiration into action. And if anyone can put things into action, it’s someone who can squat 230lbs...which incidentally, is something Britt can do.

bio: |
  Britt stumbled her way into the nonprofit sector as a volunteer/intern for a fledgling nonprofit back in 2008. From there, she took on roles as a grant manager and more traditional fundraising roles at a number of organizations. She even went on to receive a Professional Certificate in Nonprofit Fundraising from the Willamette Valley Development Officers (WVDO) and PSU; and she’s a founding board member of YNPN Portland. If you can't tell by now, Britt likes to keep busy (seriously, SO busy!), so she also pursued her MBA while she was Development Director of Harper’s Playground.

  Britt also joins the ranks of other fitness fanatics at ThinkShout...she’s into crossfit, powerlifting, plays soccer and (occasionally) makes time to run and practice yoga. Sounds like our 2 o’clock planking crew has a new member!
