  When Jeff was growing up, he would tell people he was going to be an artist. He didn’t know what _kind_ of art, but knew that he wanted to create.

bio: |
  Jeff’s history building websites goes back to his high school days. At the time it was all static html (pre css). As an efficiency appreciator, Jeff kept thinking “there has to be a more efficient way,” which ignited his exploration of .NET and MySQL.

  Eventually, what was once a spark of curiosity grew into a bonfire of passion and excitement as he thought about the way technology–performance, theory, execution, practice, and philosophy–has grown and will continue to grow. Jeff equates the harmony of modern technology to an art form. In our book, he achieved his desired status as artist!

  When he’s not making programmatic works of art, he enjoys many hobbies like vintage motorsports, music, intramural sports, photography, 3D printing, and travelling. In fact, Jeff spent six weeks alone in India in 2017 travelling various remote areas. He says, “getting dropped off in a mountain town (maybe 600 residents) with virtually no English speaking residents after an eight hour cab ride was one of the most vivid memories of my life.” We believe him!
