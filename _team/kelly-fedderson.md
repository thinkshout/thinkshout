bio: |
  Kelly joins the ranks of our staff that come from the nonprofit world. She largely focused on civic engagement and building community capacity for social change. While at a local grantmaking nonprofit, she worked with the leadership team and broader community to integrate diversity, equity, and inclusion principles into all components of our grantmaking process. This change management process included refining the funding criteria to prioritize projects led by or in collaboration with historically marginalized populations, using targeted outreach and offering technical support to bring in attract new grant applicants, increasing the accessibility of program materials, and recruiting diverse grant selection committee members. She also implemented  systems which allowed the organization to define and measure success.
  <p>When she’s not working on problem solving for social good organizations, Kelly volunteers and is active in the animal welfare sector. She’s even done wildlife rehabilitation...so if you spot a bobcat in need of assistance, she’s your gal!
