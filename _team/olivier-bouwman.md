  Olivier considers himself a maker. These days, that mostly means websites and the occasional art project. But there was that one time he built a mini golf course in his side yard.

bio: |
  Olivier got his start in web development when the Netscape browser was the hot new thing. He cut his coding teeth helping his father develop a digital library for a local university. Born and raised in the Netherlands, Olivier studied computer science and put his schooling to work in telecommunications. He spent nearly eight years juggling the roles of project manager and software developer. He eventually found himself roaming the U.S. in a Volkswagen bus - as all good adventures begin - and wound up in the Pacific Northwest. Now heâ€™s settled in Portland, putting his years of software engineering experience to use for our nonprofit clients. His mini golf course, <a href="http://twinpinescountryclub.com/">Twin Pines Country Club</a>, is also open to the public.
