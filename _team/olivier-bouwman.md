  Olivier considers himself a maker. These days, that mostly means websites and the occasional art project. Or a mini golf course in his backyard.

bio: |
  Olivier got his start in web development when the Netscape browser was the hot new thing. He cut his teeth helping his father develop a digital library for a local university, and he hasn’t looked back. Born and raised in the Netherlands, Olivier studied computer science and put his schooling to work for a while in the creative industry, and later spent some time as a consultant. He eventually found himself roaming the U.S. in a Volkswagen van - as all good adventures begin - and eventually wound up in the Pacific Northwest. Now he’s settled in Portland, putting his years of software engineering experience to use for our nonprofit clients.
