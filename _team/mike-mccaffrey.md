  Mike’s first instinct with new technology is to take it apart to see how it works. While that doesn’t necessarily bode well for the future of our new coffee maker, it does mean that Mike won’t rest until he knows a new website framework inside and out.

bio: |
  Mike comes to us with a strong background in Drupal development for nonprofits. For the past few years, he’s been a prolific member of the Drupal community, and is one of the architects behind the Drupal fork, Backdrop CMS. He’s passionate about helping nonprofits build powerful websites to support their mission. When he’s not busy tackling the latest client project, he’s learning how to spin and knit, because that’s what you do when you have two really fluffy angora rabbits.
