  Andy started out as a graphic designer, but all it took was seeing a page he coded live in a browser to change his career path entirely.

bio: |
  Andy was more interested in building systems to solve design problems than designing itself. That’s where his interest in web design, and more specifically coding, came into play. Seeing what a few lines of code could create on a page was absolute magic to him.
  <p>This passion evolved into managing and developing new features for a rather complicated Drupal 5 (and eventually Drupal 6) website. At that point, Andy realized that he was more drawn to backend development. So, he found a position at a Drupal agency where he took on the role of developing complex backend features and providing technical direction for Drupal 7 and Drupal 8 websites.
  <p>Andy loves web development, and also wants to help make the world better -- which makes him a great fit for ThinkShout! When Andy isn’t building websites, he’s busy  with photography, listening to and discovering new music, meditation, energy work, and playing with his children.
