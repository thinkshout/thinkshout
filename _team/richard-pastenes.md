bio: |
  Richard didn’t just happen to fall upon coding- he has been obsessed with figuring out how things work from a young age. From tinkering with his toys to getting in trouble for taking apart (and putting back together) his dad’s car stereo, Richard was driven to pursue the analytical, yet creative, field of Electronic Engineering. On top of having an Associates degree in Web design and Bachelors in Electronic Engineering, Richard has co-owned a computer repair shop (which doubled as an internet cafe), managed the IT department of a mining company, and even had a stint as a graphic designer for a local magazine.
  <p>Before joining our team, Richard worked as a Web Developer for Nia, a mind-body movement company, and later as a Senior Web Developer with Intuitive Digital. Richard isn’t just a digital rockstar who was born in the driest desert in the world-- he’s also an avid photographer, lunch skipper, hiker, and adventure seeker. (I mean, who would move to a new country to marry the love of their life other than someone who loves adventure?) When he’s not busy transforming code into beautiful websites, you can find him hiking, fixing bikes, or taking photos.
