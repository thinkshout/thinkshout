bio: |
  Sarah has been an art student for much of her life, but there is a definite distinction between art and design. To put it in her own words, "design needs to communicate." She finds the union of visual and written communication in graphic design to be a powerful force. It's a mindset we welcome here at ThinkShout, where the work of mission-driven organizations needs to be conveyed to potential supporters in a succinct but evocative manner.

   Sarah comes to ThinkShout with a BFA in Graphic Design from NC State University. It was there that she got into typography, and has been a self-proclaimed design nerd ever since! She has been designing professionally since 2008, most recently in the healthcare field. Not only does she bring a passion for design to ThinkShout, but Sarah was publishing web pages as early as age 9. If that doesn't impress you, perhaps the fact that she drove and camped across the country solo will?

   In her spare time, Sarah enjoys making costumes for her kids, cooking, vintage store digging, and making mixtapes for her friends (and coworkers!)
