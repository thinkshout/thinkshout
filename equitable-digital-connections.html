At ThinkShout, we know maintaining connections is now vital to our sense of community and support systems. The digital universe has become the new kitchen table, playground, and work station for so many across the globe. With competing priorities as we adapt to our current circumstances, making those connections accessible to *all users* has never been more important.

That’s why we’ve created Equitable Digital Connections: a series where we’ll be sharing online learning sessions, blog articles, and actionable information you can use to ensure your digital doorstep is available to everyone.

To kick off this series, we’re excited to present our #20ntc session:

**Accessibility for Teams in a Hurry**, a 30-minute presentation followed by interactive Q&A that will leave you with actionable tips and new insights to take back to your team.

Accessibility is important, and now is the time to modernize your process so your site works for all users. But where to start? If you’re interested in accessibility, but not sure what steps to take to make your site more inclusive, this session is for you. We’ll start by introducing a shared vocabulary and discuss how teams can share responsibility for fixing and avoiding accessibility errors. Next, we’ll review some common issues and discuss best practices to fix them, including tips from our own workflow. Finally, we’ll share our favorite resources and tools to bring back to your team. Bring your curiosity, and learn steps you can take to make the web work for everyone.

## About the Presenters:

Jules Khong: Jules began her career in advertising and design, but her love of building things and accessibility drew her to code and she’s never looked back. She believes equity can and should be woven into how we build things, and brings that focus to her work at ThinkShout where she leads the Accessibility Initiative. Jules is a Certified Professional in Web Accessibility (CPWA), through the International Association of Accessibility Professionals (IAAP). She has a BA in Multimedia from the University of Oregon, and a BFA in Graphic Design from the Art Institute of Portland. Over the last twelve years she’s partnered with agencies and nonprofits alike to build things, solve problems, and hopefully make the world a little better.

Vicki Brown: After spending 15 years of producing award-winning digital and print designs for nonprofits and small businesses, Vicki came to ThinkShout eager to partner with people who share her vision of using strategy, design and technology to help the causes she’s passionate about. While pursuing her BFA in graphic design at the Maryland Institute College of Art, Vicki discovered the power of visual communication, and that it could inspire as well as create a more equitable world through access to information. Since joining ThinkShout, Vicki has had the honor to partner with organizations like the Southern Poverty Law Center, the Center for Reproductive Rights and Women for Women International to design robust and accessible websites and digital products. She continues to pursue new ways to create thoughtful user experiences and design systems that will reach all audiences.
