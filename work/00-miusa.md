  Mobility International USA (MIUSA) provides disabled youth with resources and connections for traveling abroad. Given our team's interest in international adventure, we were eager to get involved. We redesigned MIUSA's site to inspire students to overcome adversity and see the world. Web accessibility, of course, was a critical feature of this project.

      We kicked off this project with a lively onsite discovery engagement at MIUSA's international headquarters in Eugene, Oregon. Through a series of hands-on exercises, including a "Cores & Paths" workshop, we helped MIUSA establish a new vision for its website. This vision included a student-centric graphic design and the creation of a robust resource library with a powerful and intuitive search interface.

      One of the major challenges of this project was the consolidation and restructuring of content from three "program specific" microsites into a single website with consistent messaging and smooth linkages between content sections. The project also included a deep investigation of website analytics and user trends.

      In the end, we released a website designed around the mobile user experience. Using website accessibility tools such as Google Wave and the JAWS screen reader, we ensured that the new site could be experienced and enjoyed by visitors with visual and physical impairments.
