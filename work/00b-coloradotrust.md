  [The Colorado Trust](http://www.coloradotrust.org/) is dedicated to ending health inequalities that affect racial, ethnic, low-income, and other vulnerable populations. The Trust came to us looking to communicate more effectively across geographic, socioeconomic, and technological divides.

    column1: | 
      The Trust came to us at an interesting period in its history. They were just kicking off an innovative, and fundamental, change in their funding model and organizational structure. Consequently, we needed to pay close attention in thinking through information architecture to make sure that we were _future proofing_ the new website.

  - title: Speaking to Diverse Audiences
    column1: |
      The Colorado Trust serves a wide range of stakeholders, from health care policy experts in Denver to grassroots community organizers in small mountain towns on the Western Slope. In designing the site, we had to find the right balance of open, inviting content layouts that would attract new audiences with the robust search interface that policy researchers need.

  - title: Metrics-Driven Feature Development
    column1: | 
      For this redesign, our team pioneered ["Desire Paths Analysis,"](/blog/category/desire-paths/) as part of a larger rethinking of how we approach requirements gathering and discovery. In 2014, we shifted our discovery process to focus on __measurement__ with the mantra: "If you can't measure the impact of changing something on your website, don't do it."

      The results of this adjustment to our approach have been dramatic, and overwhelmingly positive in the case of this website redesign. In the months following The Colorado Trust's website relaunch, overall page views on the site increased by 53% over the same period the previous year. The site's bounce rate dropped by 11%, and the duration of site visits increased by 76%. The results of this redesign were even more stunning with respect to mobile traffic, where session duration increased by 111%.

      We couldn't be more happy knowing, in measurable terms, that the UX improvements we suggested for the site have had such an impact. Of course, the fact that we were able to drop the average page load time by 41% has helped the site as well. Overall, we are incredibly proud of our team's collaboration on this project with the Trust's communications team. We encourage you to experience [The Colorado Trust's new site](http://www.coloradotrust.org) for yourself.
