  Ocean Outcomes is dedicated to the growth of locally-led, independently-supported conservation projects that improve ocean fisheries. The organization grew out of the work of the [Wild Salmon Center's State of the Salmon program](http://thinkshout.com/work/fip-tracker/).

  In announcing their founding, Ocean Outcomes sought to invest as much of its digital communications budget as possible into design, user experience, and content strategy. They were hesitant to invest in a _heavy_ CMS. However, they did have a need for a multilingual content management solution.

  - title: Long-form storytelling
    column1: |
      Our user exerperience and graphic design choices were guided by a strong interest in telling the compelling and highly-visual stories of fisheries conservation around the globe. Consequently, we chose to implement a ["flat design"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_design) that allows imagery and content to stand for itself in a most digestible manner.

  - title: Innovating with Jekyll
    column1: |
      We've been building client websites in [Jekyll](/blog/category/jekyll/) for quite a while now with great results. For this project, we introduced new deployment workflows built on top of [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/). We also successfully implemented translation management with Jekyll for the first time.
