client: We’re water-lovers here at ThinkShout. Naturally, we care about what lives in them as well. So when we met with the Environmental Defense Fund to talk about seafood preservation, we were all ears. Through science and economics, they advocate for seafood preservation and conscientious seafood consumption, and EDF wanted to be able to reach consumers whether they were at home or at the market.  Working with their internal development team, we set about redesigning the user experience for the Seafood Selector, a long-standing consumer advocacy tool.

      Our discovery process consisted of a thorough study of the EDF’s target audiences and the creation of a performance benchmark based on existing analytics.  We also reached out to stakeholders to get a better sense of what visual impact they wanted to make with this tool.

      We developed clickable wireframes that performed beautifully on a variety of devices. As usual, our mobile-first approach ensured that users could easily navigate the tool no matter how they chose to browse.

      After creating style tiles and a design guideline, we were able to successfully hand it off to the internal development team and help re-introduce the Seafood Selector to the world. The result was a highly interactive, easy-to-use chart that informed consumers about the economic impact of their seafood choice as well as the contaminants often found in those fish.
