  Through education and advocacy, the Los Angeles Conservancy preserves historic buildings. When we met the Conservancy team, they were struggling to engage stakeholders through their aging website and cumbersome collection of online giving and event management tools. They wanted an interactive and mobile-friendly solution that would allow their constituents to easily sign up for walking tours and explore their community's rich architectural history.

  - title: Discovery
    column1: |
      The Conservancy maintains a rich library of photos and articles about hundreds of unique buildings throughout Los Angeles County. We had an opportunity to visit this library when we kicked off our onsite discovery work. During this phase of the project, we utilized a number of "card sorting" exercises to focus our approach to tackling this large, complex redesign.

  - title: Salesforce Integration
    column1: |
      Upon completing information architecture and graphic design, we embarked upon an ambitious CRM integration, the likes of which had never been done before. This project led to a number of open source contributions, such as improvements to the Leaflet, MailChimp, iATS, and Salesforce modules for Drupal. The result was a seamless e-commerce and event ticketing solution that supports real-time data syncing between Drupal and Salesforce.

  - title: Mapping
    column1: |
      This project gave us a fun opportunity to play with map-based storytelling. We built interactive maps with geolocation and proximity search features that help people learn about historic locations on their mobile devices while they are out and about exploring the city.
