  The big picture concept of fisheries conservation is simple: fish consumers should understand the value of eco-friendly seafood; fish suppliers should know where the fish they sell comes from; and fishermen should be paid well to fish sustainably. 

  Our friends at the Wild Salmon Center asked us to help them address the issue of salmon conservation through the development of their FIP (Fishery Improvement Project) Tracker, a web-based application that helps environmentalists, fishermen, and salmon wholesalers better understand the pressure placed on Pacific salmon fisheries.

      A number of conservation organizations have released web-based tools for tracking fishery improvement projects. In designing our web application, we surveyed these tools and interviewed a variety of fishery stakeholders to develop a mobile-friendly web application that emphasizes usability and that presents fisheries data more intuitively.

      This project gave us an opportunity to showcase Drupal’s strengths as a framework for building sophisticated web applications. Leveraging Drupal’s multilingual tools, we built the application to support English and Russian data translations. Integrating Drupal’s built-in reporting engine with the [Leaflet](https://drupal.org/project/leaflet/) and [Chart.js](http://www.chartjs.org/) libraries, we were able to rapidly develop interactive graphs and robust mapping interfaces.
