_The Weekly Spark_ is here to kickstart your week. This issue is brought to you by [Kate](https://thinkshout.com/team/kate/), [Natania](https://thinkshout.com/team/natania/), [Olivier](https://thinkshout.com/team/olivier-bouwman/), [Sarah](https://thinkshout.com/team/sarah/), [Vicki](https://thinkshout.com/team/vicki/), and the rest of the ThinkShout team.

**(1) Beyoncé got sued**

Digital spaces seem to dominate our lives, from news, to education, to entertainment. Which is why when people with disabilities are blocked or unable to access your content, [it’s a civil rights issue](https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/2/5/18210912/websites-ada-compliance-lawsuits)—limiting their ability to participate in society. _[Vox]_

**(2) Facebook is the new...Slack?**

Ok, ok. Not exactly. But it’s clear from Zuckerberg’s investment in WhatsApp and Messenger that things are going in the direction of [privacy-focused communications.](https://www.recode.net/2019/3/6/18253461/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-private-messaging-future-whatsapp-messenger) _[Recode]_

**(3) Your data might be sexist.**

We often hear that data is indisputable, but data is formed from the questions we ask. Depending on who is asking the questions, [your data could be biased—and ultimately, incredibly flawed.](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/data-can-sexist-melinda-gates/) [LinkedIn]

**(4) How politically open-minded is your state?**

With the ability to curate social feeds, many of us operate in a political echo chamber. But how does where you live affect your political bias? [This data visualization says it may have a greater impact than you think.](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/03/us-counties-vary-their-degree-partisan-prejudice/583072/) _[The Atlantic]_

**(5) Disasters exacerbate wealth inequality.**

Climate change is the driving force behind our extreme weather patterns. And in times of disaster recovery, federal recovery is allocated according to cost-benefit calculations meant to minimize taxpayer risk. The tl;dr: [after a disaster, rich people get richer and poor people get poorer.](https://www.npr.org/2019/03/05/688786177/how-federal-disaster-money-favors-the-rich) _[NPR]_

**(6) First, do no harm: A Hippocratic Oath for programmers**

What gets built is a reflection of the person building it—not just their vision, but their influences, worldview, and experiences shape the final product. That’s why it’s been suggested that [“ethical training can empower technology workers by providing a framework for how to think about the impact and ethical implications of their work.”](https://onezero.medium.com/programmers-need-a-hippocratic-oath-4a2435a7524) [OneZero]


**(7) News via Instagram.**

In this day and age of short attention spans, we dig [this format of reporting from Jessica Yellin](https://www.instagram.com/jessicayellin/), former CNN Chief White House Correspondent.  [Instagram]
