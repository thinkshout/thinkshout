We recently teamed up with Drupalize.me to produce a brand new (free!) video tutorial: "[Introduction to RedHen CRM](https://drupalize.me/videos/introduction-redhen-crm)."

In this introductory video, you'll tour RedHen CRM's central features, get a detailed walkthrough of the setup process, and learn a few of RedHen's cool tricks, like duplicate management (a pet feature of mine). This is a great resource for anyone who is looking for a step-by-step guide to setting up and configuring RedHen, or just wants to learn more about it!
