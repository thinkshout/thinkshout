We've got lots of updates in the world of voice-activated assistants—both alarming and inspiring, and some food for thought when it comes to other dominant narratives in digital strategy today. As always, we hope one of these must-reads sparks your week!

**(1) Is Alexa always recording us?**

Well, not at the moment. [But Amazon has filed for a patent that records constantly, even before you say “Alexa!”](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/nicolenguyen/amazon-echo-record-audio-before-alexa-wakeword-patent) so that more informal, conversational prompts trigger an action. It’d also—ostensibly—mean a constant cycle of deleting that audio, but when it comes to preventative privacy on the Internet, we’re not holding our breath. _[Buzzfeed]_

**(2) On the flip side, though**

On Red Nose Day, instead of a simple “good morning” salutation, Alexa prompted users to consider making a donation. There’s almost always an upside to technology: [But is this kind of planned interruption actually effective?](https://www.philanthropy.com/article/Alexa-Prompts-Users-to-Donate/246354) _[Philanthropy Today]_

**(3) Last note on Alexa, but it’s an important one**

And it isn’t just about Alexa; we’re talking about Siri, too, as well as other AI-powered assistants that have female voices. Turns out that the skewed spectrum of male technologists have—no surprise here—[contributed to reinforcing gender bias in the real world.](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/22/world/siri-alexa-ai-gender-bias.html) Yikes. _[The New York Times]_

**(4) On another (urgent!) topic entirely:**

Why is the “race for 5G” even a race? Hello? Does anyone know? Consider this perspective: [The dash to the future of the Internet we’ve all been hearing about](https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/23/18637213/5g-race-us-leadership-china-fcc-lte) might be more of a manufactured message than an actual high-stakes competition for world dominance. _[The Verge]_

**(5) Back to the future…**

Speaking of the future, [certain political figures are back at it again using Facebook and Twitter as a giant machine for distorting the truth.](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/24/us/politics/pelosi-doctored-video.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share) As technologists, we’ve got to say it: These Silicon Valley giants absolutely must improve their approach to flagging and moderating out fake content. A democracy hangs in the balance! _[The New York Times]_

**(6) Speaking of, here’s a lesson in how to use your power for good:**

The programmer who created Python [only mentors those without historical access to power in tech](https://qz.com/1624252/pythons-creator-thinks-it-has-a-diversity-problem/), ie, women, people of color, those in the LGBTQ community, and of course, folks on the margins of each of those. One person, lots of power, and a deliberate choice to do better can make a huge difference. _[Quartz]_


**(7) We’ll leave you with an idea to spark change at your organization:**
