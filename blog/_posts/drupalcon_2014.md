Next week, ten members of the ThinkShout crew will ship out to Austin, Texas for DrupalCon 2014. This is our largest delegation yet and we couldn’t be more excited about it! We’ve got Drupal 8 on the brain and we’re sure you do, too. 

If you plan on attending DrupalCon in Austin, we’re always down to talk shop - or not shop. We’ll be all over the place during those four days, but here’s where you can find us:

We’d love to talk to you about the [exciting work we’re doing with the iATS Drupal Module.](http://thinkshout.com/blog/2014/05/commerce-iats-2-0/) Dan Ruscoe himself will be available to discuss his work.
