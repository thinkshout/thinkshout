Next week, nine of us will ship out to New Orleans for DrupalCon. As excited as we are to finally enjoy an authentic beignet and explore the French Quarter, the real draw here is the opportunity to once again catch up with our friends and collaborators in the Drupal community. 

We’ve been hard at work preparing our presentations and lining up BoF schedules, and putting those finishing touches on our booth. All that’s missing is you! We have five short days to see what all DrupalCon has to offer, and meet everyone we want to meet. Can we do it? Two words: Challenge accepted.

As always, if you’re reading this and you plan on attending DrupalCon, too, we want to meet you! Here’s what we’ve got lined up.

## Exhibit Hall

This year, booth 216 is the ThinkShout headquarters! Rest assured, we brought the swag. Shirts, socks, and MailChimp hats await you, so be sure to stop by and grab one before they’re all gone! We’ll also be raffling off another BB-8. All you have to do is sign up for our newsletter by dropping off a business card. Painless, right?

We’ll also be on the lookout for folks interested in pursuing the [senior engineer position](https://thinkshout.com/careers/senior-software-engineer/) we recently listed, so if you think you might be a good fit for the position and you’ll be at DrupalCon, then let’s chat! Drop us a line and we’ll set up a time to get to know each other a little better. Or just show up - that's fine too. 

## ThinkShout Sessions

“[Content Strategy in Pop Culture](https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016/sessions/content-strategy-popular-culture)” - Wednesday (5/11), 1:00pm - 2:00pm

Join Brett Meyer for an unconventional look at content strategy through a pop culture lens. Draw parallels between the information you consume every day and the sites you build, and have a little fun while doing it!

“[The Story of Successful Drupal Integrations in 3 Acts](https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016/sessions/story-successful-drupal-integrations-3-acts)” - Thursday (5/12), 10:45am - 11:45am

Lev Tsypin will share the stories of the MailChimp, iATS Payments, and Salesforce Drupal integrations, and share some insight into how to be successful when setting out to integrate Drupal with other third party systems.

## Birds of a Feather (BoF) Discussions

Our team has three birds of a feather discussions planned on the Tuesday of DrupalCon, so mark your calendars and join the conversation!

“[Fundraising in Drupal](https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016/bofs/fundraising-drupal)” - Tuesday (5/10), 11:00am - 12:00pm

“[Static Fanatic: Tips on Developing Static Sites](https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016/bofs/static-fanatics-tips-developing-static-sites)” - Tuesday (5/10), 11:00am - 12:00pm

“[Event Registration in Drupal](https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016/bofs/event-registration-drupal-8)” - Tuesday (5/10), 3:45pm - 4:45pm

Of course, we also plan on checking out the many wonderful social events that DrupalCon has in store in the evenings, so there's a good chance you'll see us there as well! It's going to be a jam-packed week, and we can't wait. As always, we're looking forward to catching lots of sessions, brushing up on trends, and learning new things. We hope to see you there!
