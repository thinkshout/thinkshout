ThinkShout is very proud to announce that [Brett Meyer](https://twitter.com/brett_meyer) has joined our team as our new Technical Project Manager!

Brett has a long history of making significant contributions to the nonprofit tech community, and for the last six years Brett was the Director of Communications at [NTEN](http://www.nten.org/).  Brett brings a wealth of knowledge surrounding nonprofit tech goals and strategies, and we are thrilled to have him on our team working closely with our nonprofit clients.  

As our technical project manager, Brett's primary objective is to help guide nonprofits we work with from discovery through launch, and to help us focus on our mission of developing useful and sustainable open source tools that help our clients achieve their goals.

Our excitement for bringing Brett on board only continues to grow as we get closer and closer to NTEN's annual [Nonprofit Technology Conference](http://www.nten.org/ntc) in Minneapolis, MN from April 11-13. For the second year in a row, we'll be organizing the [NTC Drupal Day](http://www.nten.org/ntc/precon/drupal), so be sure to stop by Drupal Day and say "Hi" to Brett!

We're glad to have you on the team, Brett!
