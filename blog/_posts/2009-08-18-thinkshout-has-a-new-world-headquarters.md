<p>We're proud to announce that we have new digs in a cool new sustainable industries incubator in the heart of downtown Portland, called the Dekum Beehive. Currently, we're pretty busy moving in, but we did take some time this morning to take some pictures of the new space. Check us out on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/16922742@N03/" target="_blank">Flickr</a> and stay tuned to hear more about our rooftop office warming party in two weeks!</p>
<p>If you want to stop by to check things out and to see if your company might be a good fit for this space, give us a call and then stop by:</p>

(UPDATE: February 14th, 2010 - Well, we had a great run at the Deekum Beehive and met some awesome people there. However, early in 2010 we decided to move over to <a href="http://nedspace.com" target="_blank">NedSpace</a> in Old Town. The truth is that our rent has jumped considerably with the move, but we wanted to be closer to our fellow Drupalistas <a href="http://levelos.com" target="_blank">LevelOS</a> and <a href="http://blacktonicapp.com" target="_blank">Black Tonic</a>. Doesn't hurt either to be so close to the awesome <a href="http://portlandten.com" target="_blank">Portland Ten</a>.
