### In supporting hundreds of sites over the past 10 years we have developed a keen understanding of what it takes to maximize the impact of your website, from optimizing performance to supporting compelling engagement strategies. 
What’s more is that we are there for you as true partners -- an extension of your team -- and we have a deep commitment to your work and understanding of your challenges. You focus on making the world a better place; we’ll take care of your website! 

Yes, it’s a bit cliche, but launching a new website is not the end of a project; it’s just the start of the next phase. For small to medium nonprofits who redirect staff and resources to the effort, this is particularly a daunting aspect of maintaining an impactful digital presence! We deeply appreciate this challenge, and believe that our new approach balances the need for focused attention, prompt action, and reasonable costs. With our new Client Support Team, you will be partnering directly with the team working on your site, so you can expect:
- Faster response and completion times
- Reduced overhead costs
- More availability from technical and strategic experts
- Predictability and consistency to support quarterly and annual planning

### We know that balancing the ongoing needs of your website, your team, and your users can be a real challenge. 
We have developed a clear set of priorities and checkpoints to ensure your digital properties stay secure, up-to-date, and optimized for the long haul, and re-structured our process with those priorities in mind. 

Moving forward, **all** ThinkShout Support clients will:
- Receive security updates as soon as they are available to ensure your site is as secure as possible. 
- Receive a quarterly newsletter with thought leadership on industry trends and best practices.
- Be invited to individualized quarterly meetings with our support team to discuss questions, feedback, and future goals.
- Have the option to purchase blocks of discounted quarterly retainer hours, or use ad hoc Time & Materials hours to cover emergent needs and requests. 
- Have the option to receive fixed fee technical and strategic services in order to maximize current and future site performance. 

### We know you might have a million questions - and we’re here to answer them all! 
The biggest thing we want you to know is we are in your corner, rooting for your success. We are excited to offer a new way to support you, your team, and your website.
