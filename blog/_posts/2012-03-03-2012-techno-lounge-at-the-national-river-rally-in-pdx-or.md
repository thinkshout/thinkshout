ThinkShout is proud to announce that we will be helping [River Network](http://rivernetwork.org) organize the first ever "Techno-Lounge" event at the [2012 National River Rally](http://rivernetwork.org/rally) in Portland, OR. This reception on the evening of Saturday, May 5th, will provide an opportunity for technology leaders in the river protection and conservation community to show-off their wares, their maps, their apps and other web-based tools. By participating in this event, organizations can help their fellow watershed advocates better understand how they can leverage technology to support our shared goals of conserving rivers across the country. Also...participants will have the opportunity to drink great PNW beer, as the Techno-Lounge will be a cornerstone of the Rally reception on Saturday night.

If you are interesting in participating as a presenter at the Techno-Lounge, and you want to come out, show of your work, share your knowledge, network with other river conservation techies, please get in touch with me by Friday, March 23rd. I can be reached at: 760.223.0589 or via our website's [contact form](/contact).

(Please note that while there is no charge for River Rally participants to be involved with this activity, River Rally is also not able to provide you with a guaranteed presenter discount. However, if you meet eligibility requirements, you will receive priority consideration for River Rally scholarships. If you are not planning on attending River Rally but would like to participate in the Techno-Lounge, let us know - and we can discuss nominal costs for participating this evening.)
 
River Rally 2012, a joint production of Waterkeeper Alliance and River Network, will take place in Portland, Oregon on May 4-7. The conference will be one of the largest gatherings of clean water advocates ever.  If you have any questions regarding the River Rally 2012, please visit www.riverrally.org.
