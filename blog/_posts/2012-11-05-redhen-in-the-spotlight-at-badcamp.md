I just got back from a fabulous weekend at [BADCamp](http://2012.badcamp.net/) where we had the chance to discuss [RedHen CRM](http://drupal.org/project/redhen) at the [nonprofit](http://2012.badcamp.net/program/non-profit-summit) and [product summits](http://2012.badcamp.net/program/product-summit). These videos were generously filmed by [Nicholas Roberts](http://niccolox.com). The first is an in-depth discussion of RedHen CRM, covering why we built a native Drupal CRM in the first place, the technology that makes it possible, and  applicable business cases. The second is cage match, err, make that panel ;), pitting RedHen against [Trellon](http://www.trellon.com)'s [CRM Core](http://drupal.org/project/crm_core), [Jackson River](http://jacksonriver.com)'s [Springboard](http://www.jacksonriver.com/springboard), and [CiviCRM](http://civicrm.org). It was an honor and a pleasure to compare and contrast RedHen with those other amazing CRM offerings. RedHen CRM is already in use in over [200 projects](http://drupal.org/project/usage/redhen), including our own [Mission Investors Exchange](/portfolio/mission-investors-exchange) and will soon launch as a core component of a private distribution for the [Forum of Regional Association of Grant Makers](http://www.givingforum.org/s_forum/index.asp).
