<p>This summer I joined the dark side...I moved away from using an Ubuntu laptop to a MacBook. More recently, I switched code editors from Komodo Edit to TextMate.</p>
<p>As a Drupal developer, I can't recommend TextMate enough. The <a href="http://drupal.org/project/textmate" target="_blank">Drupal PHP bundle</a> for Textmate is great. Auto-completion of Drupal hooks saves me considerable time.</p>

<p>I also just started using the "It's All Text" Firefox plug-in that allows you to edit web form content areas with any text editor. Combining this little plug-in with TextMate's Lorem Epsum quick tab function saves me considerable time on those not-so-infrequent times that you need quick placeholder content.</p>
