[Families USA](http://www.familiesusa.org) is a nonprofit organization that seeks to be the go-to resource for timely information on pressing health care related issues.

Based on its historical expertise and results in consumer health care advocacy, Families USA has a solid reputation and credibility with Policy-makers, the Media, and Partnering Organizations. At the highest level, the strength of its subject matter experts, earned media, and wealth of published resources enable Families USA to achieve all other organizational goals.

###Our Role###
Our goal was to ensure as dialogs surrounding healthcare advocacy continue to expand  Families USA is able to effectively communicate its brand and credibility to a new, broader audience.

####Data migration - making content staging a breeze####
To start this meant migrating approximately [100 published resources](http://www.familiesusa.org/library) (with 700 related documents), [240 press releases](http://www.familiesusa.org/press-release), [600 blog posts](http://www.familiesusa.org/blog), [215 news items](http://familiesusa.org/news) and [60 authors](http://familiesusa.org/perspective) from a Google Spreadsheet into the new site. This enabled Families USA to begin staging content well before the site was ready for actual content staging so that when it was, content staging was a breeze.

####Engaging variable audiences - complexity cloaked in simplicity####
We then had the challenge of engaging two very different sets of consituents:
* **General public**: users with less topical knowledge that find Families USA because of a curiosity about an issue and a desire to learn more.
* **Policy Makers, the Media, & Partnering Organizations**: users with high levels of topic knowledge and inï¬‚uence look to Families USA for information to support their work.

To achieve this we present [key issues](http://www.familiesusa.org/issues) surrounding healthcare in a way that is easily accessible to the general public while also providing a [powerful search tool](http://www.familiesusa.org/library) that levereges [Apache Solr](https://lucene.apache.org/solr) to allow experts to quickly and easily find topic specific information.

Additionally we provide simple, yet powerful links between the two by using a pre-filtered search technique. For example if a member of the general public happens upon [a blog post](http://familiesusa.org/blog/2014/03/independents-want-improvements-affordable-care-act-not-repeal) via social media they can activate a pre-filtered search for the Key Issue the blog post addresses by clicking on the link to the Key Issue available from the bottom of the blog post page.

####Conclusion####
ThinkShout is proud to be a part of advancing progressive policy and dialog with respect to healthcare in America and even more proud that a tool we built is [helping Americans get the healthcare coverage they need](http://familiesusa.org/initiatives/my-coverage-story).
