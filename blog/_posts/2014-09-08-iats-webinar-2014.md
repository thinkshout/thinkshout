At DrupalCon Austin, I gave a presentation on [Commerce iATS](https://www.drupal.org/project/commerce_iats), the module we developed to integrate payment processing using iATS Payments into Drupal. [iATS Payments](http://home.iatspayments.com/) has made a huge investment in Drupal and the open source community by sponsoring development of Commerce iATS since April. They even had a presence at DrupalCon and were on hand to answer developers' questions.

If you missed us at DrupalCon, iATS Payments has you covered with an upcoming webinar and a new presentation about Commerce iATS.

We'll be breaking things up into three sections:

* An introduction to iATS Payments
* An overview of the Commerce iATS Module implementation and configuration
* A look at the code

We'll be covering all of the standard Commerce iATS capabilities:

* What Commerce iATS is and how it integrates with Drupal
* Accepting credit card, ACH/EFT and recurring payments
* Accepting Direct Debit payments from UK customers

We'll also be covering these recent Commerce iATS additions:

* Using Direct Post to securely send payments directly to iATS Payments
* Using an encrypted USB card reader to process payments with a physical credit card

The webinar will take place on Wednesday, September 17 from 11:00 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. PDT. The code review will be followed by a session of Q&A. Sign up to get your questions answered. [Registration is open now](https://www2.gotomeeting.com/register/433030410).

If you'd like to get some reading in before the webinar, you can brush up on iATS Payments at their recently launched [Developer Site](http://home.iatspayments.com/developers).
