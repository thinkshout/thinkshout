October is National Breast Cancer Awareness month, so the timing couldn’t be more right for ThinkShout to officially launch the Young Survival Coalition’s updated site. [www.youngsurvival.org](http://www.youngsurvival.org/)

This past spring, YSC asked ThinkShout to take its existing, proprietary back-end and bring everything into Drupal. And because of the importance and high profile of [Breast Cancer Awareness Month](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Breast_Cancer_Awareness_Month) it had to be done by October 1st. 

Through our discovery process, we learned that YSC was happy with their existing site design, but needed a more flexible, scalable and user-friendly back-end solution, not just for staff but visitors and contributors as well.

We migrated hundreds of pages of YSC’s content, including more than [150 survivor stories](http://www.youngsurvival.org/breast-cancer-in-young-women/learn/survivor-stories). These powerful stories share the knowledge and inspiration of young women who have been affected by breast cancer, told in their own words. 

“Please keep in mind that cancer hadn't even come across my mind yet,” [writes one young woman on the site](http://www.youngsurvival.org/survivor-stories/aimees-story-diagnosed-at-29) about an inconclusive mamogram.  “Oh sure, I told my husband that if it turned out to be cancer (which it couldn't possibly be) that I would remove both of my breasts and everything would be hunky dory. Oh how wrong I was.”

In addition to survivor stories, YSC’s site is full of information about breast cancer in general, getting involved and volunteering, and one of the most extensive and useful [FAQs](http://www.youngsurvival.org/breast-cancer-in-young-women/faq) about the subject we’ve seen in a long time. 

ThinkShout is proud of all of our clients, and we value the work they do. This October, we’re especially proud of YSC.
