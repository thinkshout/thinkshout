The Nonprofit Technology Conference is just around the corner, and we’re hard at work making those final preparations for our trip to D.C. We have some exciting things in store for you this year, so mark your calendars!

## Drupal Salon

This year, we’re honored to coordinate the first ever Drupal Salon at the NTC. In lieu of the traditional pre-conference days as we’ve done in previous years, NTEN set aside space and time for subject matter experts to present nine twenty-minute-long talks on all things Drupal on Thursday, March 23rd. These talks will take place as part of the formal NTC schedule, and sessions can be viewed in the [Wordpress & Drupal Salon tracks on the NTC site](https://www.nten.org/ntc/program/agenda/). 

We’re excited to have experts from the Southern Poverty Law Center, Shatterproof, and the Center for Strategic and International Studies share their Drupal insight and experiences. ThinkShout will also be providing one-on-one consulting at our Drupal Salon table, so bring us all of your Drupal questions! Drupal hosting providers Pantheon and Acquia will also be on hand to tackle whatever Drupal hosting questions you may have.

We hope you’ll be able to join us! Here’s what we’ll be talking about:

* “[Stories that Matter: How the SPLC Responded to the 2016 Election](https://www.nten.org/session/stories-that-matter-how-the-splc-responded-to-the-2016-election/)” - Alex Amend, Digital Media Director (The Southern Poverty Law Center)

* “[Rapid Response Options in Drupal](https://www.nten.org/session/rapid-response-options-in-drupal/)” - Eric Paxton, Senior Front End Engineer (ThinkShout)

* “[Drupal-Powered Digital Storytelling](https://www.nten.org/session/drupal-powered-digital-storytelling/)” - Brett Meyer, Director of Strategy (ThinkShout)

* “[Drupal as a Hub: Custom Integrations for CSIS](https://www.nten.org/session/drupal-as-a-hub-custom-integrations-for-csis/)” - Ian Gottesman, Chief Information Officer (CSIS)

* “[Integrating Drupal and Salesforce](https://www.nten.org/session/integrating-drupal-and-salesforce/)” - Lev Tsypin, Founder & CEO (ThinkShout)

* “[Event Registration with Drupal](https://www.nten.org/session/event-registration-with-drupal/)” - Gabe Carleton-Barnes, Engineering Manager (ThinkShout)

* “[How Shatterproof Fights Addiction with Compelling Content](https://www.nten.org/session/how-shatterproof-fights-addiction-with-compelling-content/)” - Anthony Della Camera, Technology Director & Jessica Ishikawa, Interactive Designer (Shatterproof)

* “[Content Modeling for Drupal-based Websites](https://www.nten.org/session/content-modeling-for-drupal-based-websites/)” - Brett Meyer, Director of Strategy (ThinkShout)

* “[Leveraging Drupal in Your Marketing Strategies](https://www.nten.org/session/leveraging-drupal-in-your-marketing-strategies/)” - Natania LeClerc, Senior Digital Engagement Strategist (ThinkShout)

We’re confident that the Drupal Salon sessions will have a little something for everyone, and we look forward to connecting with the nonprofit community with this new format.

## Meet the ThinkShout Team

Be sure to catch our team session on March 23rd, as well! 

* “[How to Learn to Stop Worrying and Love Your Digital Agency](https://www.nten.org/session/how-to-learn-to-stop-worrying-and-love-your-digital-agency/)” - Alex Amend (Southern Poverty Law Center), Michele Kayal (Relief International), Alex MacMillan (ThinkShout), and Lev Tsypin (ThinkShout)

The ThinkShout team will have a presence in the Exhibit Hall this year, of course. Stop by our booth (#501) and chat; we’ll be debuting brand new t-shirts and we’re excited to share them with you all (for free)! This is a great opportunity to learn more about our work and the organizations we partner with. We’re also available to talk about anything B Corp related, so send those questions our way!

If you’d like to schedule a time to meet with our staff at the NTC in advance, drop us a line through our [contact form](https://thinkshout.com/contact/). See you in the capitol!
