## Start Small

Give yourself a scope that is reasonable. For example, committing to make all new content accessible is more doable than retrofitting hundreds of pages of old articles. Set goals that are both ambitious and reasonable.

## Read the Guidelines

Select the compliance level you’re working toward to get a better understanding of what accessibility means. Then it won’t feel so complicated.

## Simplify the Language on Your Team

If you decide to meet WCAG 2.1 AA, don’t make people say that. Just call them ‘the guidelines’. Have a shared vocabulary so everyone can participate without having to be overwhelmed by a bunch of new acronyms.

## Pick Your Testing Tools

This way, your team is measuring success in the same way. Define when testing should happen in your process and who is doing it. Build in redundancies so you can look out for each other as you go.

## Most Importantly, Support Each Other!

We’re learning new things all the time, and it’s just part of the process. You’ve got this! Just take it one step at a time.
