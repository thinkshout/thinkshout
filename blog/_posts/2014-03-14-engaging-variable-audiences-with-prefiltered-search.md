[Families USA](http://www.familiesusa.org) is a nonprofit organization that seeks to be the go-to resource for timely information on pressing health care related issues.

Historical expertise and strong results in consumer health care advocacy have given Families USA a solid reputation and credibility with Policy-makers, the Media, and Partnering Organizations. However, as the dialog surrounding healthcare advocacy continues to expand, Families USA needed to be able to effectively communicate its brand and credibility to a new, broader audience...and this is where we came in.

##Engaging variable audiences - complexity cloaked in simplicity##
We had the challenge of engaging two very different sets of constituents:

* **General public**: users with less topical knowledge that find Families USA because of a curiosity about an issue and a desire to learn more.
* **Policy Makers, the Media, & Partnering Organizations**: users with high levels of topic knowledge and inï¬‚uence look to Families USA for information to support their work.

To achieve this at a high level, for example when either type of constituent visits the site home page, we present [key issues](http://www.familiesusa.org/issues) surrounding healthcare in a way that is easily accessible to the general public while also providing a [powerful search tool](http://www.familiesusa.org/library) that levereges [Apache Solr](https://lucene.apache.org/solr) to allow experts to quickly and easily find topic specific information.

Additionally, on more specific content pages, we provide simple, yet powerful links between the user-friendly content page and the resource library search tool by using a pre-filtered search technique. For example when a constituent happens upon [a blog post](http://familiesusa.org/blog/2014/03/independents-want-improvements-affordable-care-act-not-repeal) via social media they can activate a pre-filtered search for the Key Issue the blog post addresses by clicking on the link to the Key Issue available from the bottom of the blog post page.

This allows the general public to learn more about an issue quickly and easily, while allowing higher level users to dig deeper with the same quickness and ease.
