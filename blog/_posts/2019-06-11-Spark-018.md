We’re truly mixing it up this week: from AI and machine learning, to decolonizing design, to accessibility in museums and bringing novels to Instagram. Here are the stories that caught our eye.

**(1) The robots can’t do it all.**

Authenticity. Intimacy. Navigating nuance. Emotional intelligence. What are we listing out? Oh, just [the key skills you'll need to master if you want a job in our increasingly robotized future, of course.](https://onezero.medium.com/why-my-job-is-safe-from-the-robots-b2013637368a) _[One Zero]_

**(2) This app will save lives.**

Imagine if the next time a person of color gets stopped by police, they only had to touch a button on their phone to trigger a recording of their traffic stop, then it auto-sends to an emergency contact. [That’s what this app will do, and it’ll save lives.](https://twitter.com/mondaymargiela/status/1134355937404235776) [Reddit]

**(3) So cool!**

As we focus on accessibility in all sectors and industries, here are [the different ways museums nationwide are making photos and paintings available to the visually impaired.](https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2019/06/04/us/ap-us-art-for-the-blind.html)  _[The New York Times]_

**(4) The triple line we all know and love...**

The history of [the hamburger icon](https://www.invisionapp.com/inside-design/an-oral-history-of-the-hamburger-icon-from-the-people-who-were-there/), now ubiquitous in much of our online experience. _[Inside Design]_

**(5) Decolonizing design.**

[And how to avoid taking charge of another person’s narrative or lived experience.](https://eyeondesign.aiga.org/what-does-it-mean-to-decolonize-design/) _[AIGA Eye on Design]_

**(6) The carbon footprint of machine learning.**

On processing power and [what questions we should be asking when we quantify the true value of machine learning:](https://www.fastcompany.com/90360528/the-code-that-powers-our-lives-has-a-hidden-environmental-toll) “If all this carbon footprint and money is required to train the model, maybe that would be reasonable if it’s a groundbreaking, innovative model that’s changing the face of research, increasing accuracy, and really solving a problem,” she says. “All people care about is making the [accuracy] number higher at any cost. We shouldn’t be doing that. It’s just not responsible.”  _[Fast Company]_

**(7) Insta-novels.**

“Instagram is arguably today’s most democratic storytelling tool.” That statement makes it no surprise that [Mother New York utilized Instagram to bring novels to the greater public in their campaign with the New York Public Library.](https://www.webbyawards.com/news/webby-instagram-all-stars-insta-novels/?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=webbyNL&utm_term=4june2019)  [The Webby Awards]
