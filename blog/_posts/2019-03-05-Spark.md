_The Weekly Spark_ is here to kickstart your week. This issue is brought to you by [Brendan](https://thinkshout.com/team/brendan/), [Eric](https://thinkshout.com/team/eric/), [Kate](https://thinkshout.com/team/kate/), [Natania](https://thinkshout.com/team/natania/), and the rest of the ThinkShout team.

**(1) On technical inventions that have changed everything…**

From doing dishes to seeing clearly to medical innovations that have saved millions on millions of lives, [nothing would be the same if not for these brilliant Black innovators.](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/24/us/black-inventors.html) _[New York Times]_

**(2) Data! Security!**

Ok, ok. So basically no one gets as excited about security and privacy as we do. But if—as a small company—we can prioritize protecting our clients’ on the Internet, global corporations should be able to do the same. [It literally takes 9 steps.](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/02/announcing-fix-it-already) [Electronic Frontier Foundation]

**(3) What’s the point of wireframing?**

Before you start to question everything, take a look at this thoughtful take on whether or not [it makes sense to continue the “best practice” of wireframing.](https://medium.com/@seandexter1/wireframes-are-becoming-less-relevant-and-thats-a-good-thing-e66b30724a27) _[Visual Design]_

**(4) Milliseconds earn millions.**

Google took the words right out of our mouths: [The faster your site loads, the more money you’ll be able to raise.](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-resources/experience-design/mobile-site-speed-importance/) A one-second delay in mobile load times can decrease conversion rates by up to 20 percent. (PS: We’re experts in lightening-fast sites. Ask us about what we can do for your organization.) _[Think With Google]_

**(5) Do socially responsible products make an impact?**

Well, the short of it is this: only if people buy them, and the trends are going in the wrong direction. There’s no need to panic, but [we really, really need to talk about motivations.](https://www.fastcompany.com/90310006/we-need-to-debunk-some-big-myths-about-conscious-consumers) _[Fast Company]_

**(6) Turns out that the first step is the most important step…**

When it comes to machine learning, anyway. If your data is bad—[the way it’s collected, cleaned, coded, and applied](https://hbr.org/2018/04/if-your-data-is-bad-your-machine-learning-tools-are-useless)—then the tools that flow forth are relatively useless. _[Harvard Business Review]_


**(7) Please care about 5G**

We recommend that everyone listen in to this episode of The Daily, because like it or not, [the fight for 5G may just be akin to the next virtual cold war.](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/25/podcasts/the-daily/5g-technology-huawei-china-us.html) _[New York Times]_
