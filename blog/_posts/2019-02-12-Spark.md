**(1) Ever taken a Buzzfeed quiz?**
Buzzfeed built its business on the millions of pageviews generated by its addictive quizzes. Which means that Buzzfeed actually built its business on the labor of an incredibly talented team writers and editors. And then, they laid off its director of quizzes.

**(2) WhatsApp, Instagram, and Messenger to merge.**
This could open the door for businesses to attract customers across platforms, but it should also be no surprise that this could also make it easier for Facebook to share data across platforms. [BBC News]  https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-47001460

**(3) Apps for accessibility.**
After an image went viral of a woman walking with a blindness cane while using her phone, many assumed she was faking her impairment. Turns out, she wasn’t. [Veroniiiica] https://veroniiiica.com/2019/01/28/how-i-use-my-phone-for-orientation-and-mobility/

**(4) Responsible Digital Transformation.**
How can we be sure the digital tools we create are harnessed for the greater good and not harm? Mercy Corps, Accenture, and Net Hope sit down for a conversation on Responsible Digital Transformation. [Accenture]

**(5) The 2018 Good Tech Awards**
After a year of negative news about our tech giants, it’s nice to see some press for how tech is being used for good. [The New York Times] https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/21/technology/year-in-technology-2018.html

**(6) The more you know...**
We all use Google Maps, and we all know our data is tracked; but this article lays out just how far that tracking goes. And it makes a strong case for consumers taking back ownership of their own digitized (and monetized) behavior. [Startup] https://medium.com/swlh/using-google-maps-costs-more-than-you-think-d62c7d857b2d

**(7) Mobile device designs are about to change.**
First of all, we're not convinced that these "improvements" impact user experience. And secondly? We're not convinced that the "significant" changes will ever make it to mass market. [Fast Company]
