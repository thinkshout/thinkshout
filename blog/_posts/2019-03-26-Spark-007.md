From human experiences shaping spatial experiences, to an open source initiative from the Times that will help maintain order in your life (or at least your documents). This issue is brought to you by [Kate](https://thinkshout.com/team/kate/), [Natania](https://thinkshout.com/team/natania/), [Eric](https://thinkshout.com/team/eric/), and the rest of the ThinkShout team.

**(1) Remote technology brings relief to survivors**
[Telehealth brings critical services to rural areas](https://ohiovalleyresource.org/2019/03/01/serving-survivors-in-rural-states-telemedicine-brings-treatment-for-sexual-abuse/?utm_source=Solutions+Story+Tracker&cid=pt), where partner violence happens at a higher rate, and is less frequently reported.

**(2) Authenticity on the internet is dead**
With the rise of influencers, algorithms, and bots, [who can we really trust](https://www.fastcompany.com/90317715/how-internet-popularity-killed-authenticity)? _[Fast Company]_

**(3) Location is Personal: Cartography edition**
This monthly [newsletter from Lo Bénichou and Amy Lee Walton of Mapbox](https://blog.mapbox.com/location-is-personal-issue-3-march-2019-a386534e8560) explores how human experiences shape the spatial experience. This month they dive into the concept of feminist cartography...do we have the attention of map-lovers out there? [Mapbox]

**(4) Labels can’t tell you who you are**
Eve Simon, Creative Director at Beaconfire, shares how labels can simultaneously be right and wrong; and how [simple changes by the planners of SXSW](https://medium.com/@naieve/perfectly-imperfect-6eaffe739462?sk=118122d52cc0191bb576ac739659170b) improved the experience for her exponentially.

**(5) A better way to maintain internal documentation**
We’re big fans of open source...which is why [we love this new initiative from the Times](https://open.nytimes.com/we-built-a-collaborative-documentation-site-deploy-your-own-with-the-push-of-a-button-134de99c42fc) to help make vast amounts of information centrally located, and easily findable. _[The New York Times]_

**(6) AI IRL**
At ThinkShout, we constantly explore the connection between digital engagement and real-life impact. That's why [we've got our eye on how brick and mortar retailers are applying AI to personalize in-store shopping experiences](https://www.voguebusiness.com/technology/artificial-intelligence-physical-stores-kering-nike-alibaba). [Vogue Business]

**(7) It shouldn’t be _this_ hard…**
Identifying hate speech should be pretty clear-cut, [yet Anti-Muslim bigotry in the United States continues to find a home on sites like Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2019/03/new-zealand-attack-underscores-social-media-sites-tolerance-of-anti-muslim-content/). Some groups are working hard to get such content taken down, but it shouldn’t be this challenging. _[Mother Jones]_
