We’re packing our bags for Baltimore and polishing up our slide decks for DrupalCon! We’re so excited to join the Drupal community for a full week of Drupal-y things. We’ve got some great content planned for this year’s conference, and we’re very excited to share it with you all - here’s what you need to know:

## Exhibit Hall

The ThinkShout Headquarters this year is **booth 432**! We’ll be giving away free t-shirts and raffling off an Amazon Echo. You can enter to win for the low, low price of one business card. If you have any questions about [our work](https://thinkshout.com/work/), current available [job opportunities](https://thinkshout.com/careers/), or what the [weather’s like in Portland](https://isitraining.in/Portland) (spoiler: it’s probably raining), stop by - we’d love to chat with you!

## ThinkShout Sessions

The ThinkShout team has two sessions in the DrupalCon agenda this year. We’re also very excited to be leading a discussion in our first DrupalCon Nonprofit Summit. Take a look at our lineup and mark your calendars

“[Rapid Response Campaigns & Digital Tools](https://events.drupal.org/baltimore2017/nonprofit-summit)” - Monday (4/24), 12:30 - 1:15pm, Nonprofit Summit

The news cycle doesn’t stop, and your website must help you respond to emergencies, not act as a barrier. Drupal can help you react quickly, in concert with your other channels, to turn current events into opportunities to spread your message and further your mission. In this breakout session, Brett Meyer and Lev Tsypin will talk about the tools you have at your disposal in Drupal, scenarios that call for rapid response solutions and how to implement them, and strategies that will help you turn these situations into lasting engagement with your constituents.

“[Demystifying Rendered Content in Drupal 8 Twig Files](https://events.drupal.org/baltimore2017/sessions/demystifying-rendered-content-drupal-8-twig-files)” - Tuesday (4/25), 3:45 - 4:45pm 

Amy Vaillancourt-Sals is going to show you the ins and outs of Twig! [Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/) is a robust and elegant template engine for PHP. It's lightweight, fairly quick to pick up, very readable, and it grants users ultimate control over the markup, including wrapping elements and rendering exactly the output you need. In this session, you’ll learn about the debugging process of sorting through twig variables, using xdebug in PHPStorm, the other helpful debugging tools at your disposal, plus common patterns Amy found helpful for rendering content in twig files. 

“[Content Strategy in Popular Culture, Part Deux](https://events.drupal.org/baltimore2017/sessions/content-strategy-popular-culture-part-deux)” - Thursday (4/27), 10:45 - 11:45am

Brett Meyer’s got a sequel to [his session from DrupalCon New Orleans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJxtCPRde4k). Another year, another array of pop culture obsessions to examine and apply to the work we do. By exploring how crucial aspects of content strategy play out in movies, music, comic books, and video games, we’ll continue to expand the palette of language we can use to explain and convince more people about the importance of content strategy online, and ensure they understand that it’s not just vital, but fun as well.
