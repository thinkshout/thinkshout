With the session submission deadline drawing to a close for [DrupalCon Portland 2013](http://portland2013.drupal.org), [ThinkShout](http://thinkshout.com) (along with many other fine Drupal community members) participated in the mad rush to get all of our awesome session ideas in on time!  The DrupalCon session committee has a busy couple of weeks coming their way, and in the meantime, we'd love to hear your comments and feedback on our presentation ideas.  

Our team has a broad range of topics we can't wait to share with the community, from CRM and Salesforce to Magic: The Gathering!

Check them out in more detail below, we can't wait to hear what you think:

* [Register, Pay and Attend:  Making advanced event management easy with Drupal](http://portland2013.drupal.org/session/register-pay-and-attend-making-advanced-event-management-easy-drupal) In this session [Tauno](/blog/Tauno) will be focusing on the recipes for contributed modules that can be combined to enable functionality such as: paid event registrations, early bird pricing, tracking attendance and even integrating with Salesforce. 
* [Sean](/blog/sean) and [Lev](/blog/lev) joined forces to propose [Association Management with RedHen](http://portland2013.drupal.org/session/association-management-redhen-crm), which will teach participants how to leverage RedHen CRM in building vibrant online communities and portals. 
* [Need a Drupal Website? Wait! Have you gone through a a discovery process?](http://portland2013.drupal.org/session/need-drupal-website-wait-have-you-gone-through-discovery-process) is based on ThinkShout's resident UX expert, [Brett Heckman](/blog/brett), and [Sean](/blog/sean)'s experience in guiding clients through an effective approach to beginning a website redesign project.
* [Micro-Site Development Workflows with Drush Make and Git](http://portland2013.drupal.org/session/micro-site-development-workflows-drush-make-and-git) in this proposed session, ThinkShout will be walking through the real world challenges and successes with Val Rozansky from the [Forum of Regional Associations of Grantmakers](http://givingforum.org/s_forum/index.asp) as a case study for best practices around managing micro-sites with Drush Make build process and a Git-based deployment workflow.
* In [CRM the Drupal Way](http://portland2013.drupal.org/session/crm-drupal-way), Lev and Tauno hope to take the stage to explore the ins and outs of building a CRM offering with Drupal. 
* Looking to dig into [Integrating Drupal with Salesforce](http://portland2013.drupal.org/session/integrating-drupal-salesforce)? Lev's proposed session will cover the technical aspects of integrating Drupal and Salesforce and then explore how to leverage this tool in your projects.
* Pro-Magic aficionado [Gabe Carleton-Barnes](/blog/gabe) hopes to engage audiences with the intertwine of the strategy game and open source technology in [MAGIC: The Gathering and Free/Libre/Open Source](http://portland2013.drupal.org/session/magic-gathering-and-freelibreopen-source).
* [Distributions for Site Building: Distor's aren't just for products and quick starts](http://portland2013.drupal.org/session/distributions-site-building-distros-arent-just-products-and-quick-starts) and in this session [Brandon](/blog/brandon) and Gabe hope to demonstrate how installation profiles and Drush make files are powerful tools for distribution building, and can also smooth collaborative development for one-off projects.
* [Now is the time on Sprockets when we make money:  How to run a profitable small digital agency](http://portland2013.drupal.org/session/now-time-sprockets-when-we-make-money-how-run-profitable-small-digital-agency).  In this session, I'll (fingers crossed) be joining forces with Director of Strategy, Nate Parsons at Phase2 Technology, to share best practices for improving profitability for small digital agencies.
* [Shiny Object:  Developing a cohesive PMO toolset that doesn't overwhelm your team](http://portland2013.drupal.org/session/shiny-object-developing-cohesive-pmo-toolset-doesn%E2%80%99t-overwhelm-your-team).  Nate and I will be tackling the shiny object syndrome in tool adoption to help guide attendees to develop a PMO toolset that fits for their team.
