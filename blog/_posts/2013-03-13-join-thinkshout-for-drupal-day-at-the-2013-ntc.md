<p>A few days into my work with ThinkShout, I'm pleased to report that everything I always knew must be doable with Drupal isn't just possible, it's in process. I've seen things people wouldn't believe. <a href="http://drupal.org/project/redhen">Engagement scoring tied to user activity</a>. I watched <a href="http://drupal.org/project/mailchimp">email sent from a website report stats back</a> to an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_service_provider">ESP</a>.</p>

<p>If you're interested in expanding your Drupal expertise, I encourage you to join us at "<a href="http://www.nten.org/ntc/precon/drupal">Drupal Day for Nonprofit IT Professionals</a>" at the <a href="http://www.nten.org/ntc">2013 Nonprofit Technology Conference</a>. (You already know about the NTC, right? It's awesome! Anybody involved with nonprofit technology in general should attend at least once.)</p>

<p>The team at ThinkShout is excited to be involved with facilitating the second annual iteration of this fantastic event with the support of NTEN, Zivtech, Forum One Communications, and Trellon. Drupal Day is not a training on “How to build a website with Drupal”, nor is it a Drupal vendor or product spotlight. Rather, this is a hands-on opportunity for Drupal users in the NTEN community to:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Increase dialog within the national community of Drupal professionals and IT decision-makers serving the nonprofit sector;</li> 
<li>Make connections between nonprofit IT professionals interested in different technical and process conversations that are active in the wider Drupal community;</li> 
<li>Expose the nonprofit IT community to the latest techniques, tools, and trends in Drupal development and site management; and,</li> 
<li>Start the NTC off right!</li>
 </ul>
<p>Participation in Drupal Day is free, but we're limited to 150 participants, so be sure to <a href="http://www.nten.org/ntc/precon/drupal">register now</a> before it fills up.</p>
<p>We're hoping that Drupal Day will pull together the leading minds in Drupal development for the nonprofit sector from around the country. If you're interested in helping out with case studies or other planning/facilitation opportunities, give us a shout!</p>
<p>And if you're interested in discussing the significance of the soliloquy referenced in the opening paragraph to cinematic history, be sure to look me up in Minneapolis. Yes, I'm excited to continue to provide the nptech community with the best quality referential humor in the business, in addition helping you use technology more effectively. ThinkShout encourages us all to give back to our community as much as possible, and gives us the space to do so. Anything you'd like me to explore?
