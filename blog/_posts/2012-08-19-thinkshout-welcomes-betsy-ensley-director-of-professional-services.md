ThinkShout is proud to announce that [Betsy Ensley](/team#betsy) has joined our [team](/team) as our new Director of Professional Services.

Betsy has made significant contributions to the Drupal community over the last two years. You may know Betsy from her work as the Director of Marketing at [Phase2](http://www.phase2technology.com/), her volunteer service with the Drupal Association's Marketing and Branding Committee, and her organizing efforts with the DC Drupal Users' Group.

Our excitement for bringing Betsy on board hit a new level at the end of July watching her organize the DC Drupal community's second annual [CapitalCamp](http://capitalcamp.org) (one of the premier Drupal camps in the country, which she helped establish in 2011). Betsy was well-appreciated in the DC Drupal community and we can't wait to see her get involved in here in the Pacific Northwest.

At ThinkShout, Betsy will continue her Drupal community involvement (so, don't worry, you'll continue to see her at Camps and Cons across the country). As our Director of Professional services, Betsy will help us focus on our three primary business objectives:

* Providing our clients with the highest-value open source solutions possible;
* Growing our business sustainably as premier open source contributors; and
* Fostering the ongoing professional development of our team.

Welcome, Betsy! We couldn't be more happy to have you on our team.
