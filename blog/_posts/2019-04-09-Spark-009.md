From McDonald’s acquisition of market-leading optimization software, to Patagonia opting to support more values-aligned businesses...the Spark is here to kickstart your week. Brought to you by [Brendan](https://thinkshout.com/team/brendan/), [Kate](https://thinkshout.com/team/kate/), [Natania](https://thinkshout.com/team/natania/), and [Sarah L](https://thinkshout.com/team/sarah/).

**(1) Appropriation vs. Appreciation...**  

This Twitter thread provides extensive [resources on the difference between appropriation v. appreciation, how to authentically apologize, and how we treat sacred symbols](https://twitter.com/nerdette/status/1104401355236564992) (not to mention other great people to follow on said topics). [Twitter]

**(2) Put your money where your values are.**  

Patagonia—a company with a lesbian woman at the helm—has decided to [stop making co-branded fleece vests for companies they view to be ecologically damaging](https://putthison.com/patagonia-drops-co-branded-fleece-vests/). Our read? When companies have leaders who come from diverse perspectives, economic and environmental justice aren't just values; they're practices. _[Put this On]_

**(3) McDonald's is acquiring a market-leading optimization software.**  

Why? Because the majority of Americans who love McDonald's get their food via the drive-thru, and—because drive-thru menus are digital now— [personalizing those drive-thrus means not just addictive foods on the menu, but addictive menus altogether](https://www.wired.com/story/mcdonalds-big-data-dynamic-yield-acquisition). _[Wired]_

**(4) Design as an act of service.**  

Designing medical equipment to be desirable or fashionable could remove the stigma associated with it. Here are other subtle but deeply moving ways that [design impacts our lives](https://www.commarts.com/columns/n-rregaard).  _[Communication Arts]_

**(5) Workplace surveillance is central to capitalist exploitation.**  

Current surveillance technologies have greatly increased employers' power over workers; and [we question if it actually leads to more productivity](https://truthout.org/articles/workplace-surveillance-is-central-to-capitalist-exploitation/). _[truthout]_

**(6) AMP is here for email.**  

Google officially launched AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages) for email, in its effort to [turn emails from static documents into dynamic, web page-like experiences](https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/26/google-makes-emails-more-dynamic-with-amp-for-email/). Check it out! _[TechCrunch]_

**(7) Yes, tech fuels hate speech. Let’s stop debating it and start fighting it.**  

The past several Sparks have featured stories on how social platforms are not moving fast enough to remove hate speech from their sites. [While the Internet fervently protects the first amendment, what happens when what’s being said threatens your safety to exist?](https://alistapart.com/article/canary-in-a-coal-mine-how-tech-provides-platforms-for-hate) _[A List Apart]_
