Like many developers, we get pretty psyched about building stuff. Sometimes it takes us a little longer to get excited about describing the stuff we built... but <a href="http://redhencrm.com/">RedHen</a> has been getting enough attention that it was time to do some communicating, especially considering we recently released <a href="(http://drupal.org/project/redhen">version 7.x-1.2</a> of the module.

Today we published a significant, if not quite complete, chunk of RedHen documentation to Drupal.org <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1989564">here</a>. That documentation can now grow with RedHen!

But I know what you're thinking: "Documentation? Am I having some horrible 2005 fever dream? Where's the video??"

So, ok: I made a little instructional video about getting started with RedHen. It's my first one, so critique gently: it's surprisingly difficult to converse with an imaginary audience.

This video covers installing RedHen and configuring a Contact Type, and a few other introductory RedHen tricks. Note that the video gives instructions for creating a RedHen link in the Admin toolbar, but you can also just move the pre-built RedHen menu that lives under Structure into the Toolbar to get the full drop-down fun.
