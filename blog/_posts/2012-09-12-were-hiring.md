Well, we're at it again...our team is growing as we take on more and more exciting web application development projects mostly, but not exclusively, in Drupal. ThinkShout is looking to hiring for multiple positions!

Have the words intellectually curious, self-starter or overachiever followed you around your whole life? Do you want to go to sleep each night proud of the clients you serve? Are you looking for an employer who will invest in your professional development? Are you passionate about responsive design? Does thinking about UX make you want to get out of bed in the morning? Are you looking for a cool geek community with a great location in an awesome progressive town? Do you enjoy organic burritos and acupuncture (both available downstairs from our office). Do you want you want to take your dog to work? 

If any of these are true for you, then we want to talk to you! Given our commitment to remaining a lean, "high-end, do-good" shop, you are invited to help us iterate on the culture and best practices you've always wanted on a development team.

## More About Us ##

* We work exclusively with forward-looking organizations in the for-profit, nonprofit, and government space. 
* We have strict engineering standards. We review each other's code. We write code as if every line will be seen by outside eyes. We insist on doing it right rather than doing it fast.
* *Abstraction, abstraction, abstraction* - We like to partner with our clients to release cool tools. In fact, most of the Drupal modules we've released, including [Entity Registrations](http://drupal.org/project/registration), [RedHen](http://drupal.org/project/redhen), and [Leaflet](http://drupal.org/project/leaflet) were budgeted into billable client projects.
* We don't really care about computer science degrees. We do care a lot of about the ability and desire to learn, motivation, and code.
* We try to keep work to 40 hours per week. But let's face it, the talented folks with whom we all like to work are generally reading and working on personal geek projects after hours and sometimes on the weekends. It's not a requirement, just that sort of our culture.
* While we are developing a product or two, we're first and foremost a services company. If you're not comfortable helping the team remain productive and getting projects done on time and on budget - it's probably not a great fit.
* We value communication skills over genius. (Let's face it, we're a small team of passionate technologists, we gotta be able to talk through challenges and opportunities.)
* We provide a competitive salary, flexible PTO, health care benefits including alternative treatments, and, of course, a Mac laptop.
