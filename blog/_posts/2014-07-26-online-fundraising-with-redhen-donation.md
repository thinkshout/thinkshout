One of the biggest issues our clients face is a lack of control or understanding of their donation forms. This is concerning for a number of reasons, but chiefly because so many of our nonprofit partners rely heavily on online donations to support their mission. With so much of their success hinging on the accessibility and functionality of these forms, why would we tolerate less-than stellar donation processes?

This was our mindset when we began working on the [RedHen ](https://www.drupal.org/project/redhen_donation)[Donation](https://www.drupal.org/project/redhen_donation) module. We wanted to create a tool that would allow nonprofits to keep everything under one roof, inside their CRM. What we came up with is unique in the sense that it offers nonprofits several features that aren’t quite so commonplace. RedHen Donation allows for both one-time and recurring donations. 

I chatted with [Brandon Lee](http://thinkshout.com/team/brandon/), the architect behind RedHen Donation, to get a better understanding of RedHen Donation’s capabilities.  

**Stephanie: So what’s the big deal with RedHen Donation?**

**Brandon**: It’s an integration between [RedHen CRM](http://redhencrm.com/) contacts and Drupal Commerce that allows for single page donations with both one time and recurring donations options. The recurring donations feature is a pretty big part of it, since that’s not an option you frequently see offered in other donation form tools.

**Stephanie: How does it work with RedHen CRM?**

**Brandon**: RedHen Donation allows you to create a single page donation form that can create or update RedHen contacts. It’s tightly-integrated with RedHen, so if you’re already using RedHen CRM, it’s will be very simple to get up and running.

**Stephanie: How does it compare to other donation form modules out there?**

**Brandon**: It’s a standalone module that’s used with the RedHen suite. CRM Core has a similar donation module, but it doesn’t allow for recurring donations. RedHen Donation does. The ability to give donors the option of setting up a recurring donation within the same form is something we’re thrilled to offer nonprofits.

The donation space, in a lot of ways, is what sets it apart from similar modules. If you’re dealing with Commerce specifically, it wants to lock you into the commerce workflow. With RedHen Donation, you don’t have to go through three different steps to make one donation to an organization. You fill out one page and you’re done. It’s quick and user-friendly. No more filling out a form, then passing through a portal, then onto a confirmation page, then back to your site.

**How easy is it to create a new form? Or many forms for different campaigns?**

**Brandon**: With the assumption that you already have RedHen set up, it’s relatively simple. You enable the module, then create a donation type, which is a Drupal entity, and during the configuration, you select what kind of product you’re working with - at least with one-time donations. This is  a fieldable methodology that we’ve used with MailChimp and others projects in the past. If you understand Drupal concepts of entities, fields, and commerce, then it’s simple. You do need a working knowledge of those three things to build a form. But once it’s complete, it’s incredibly simple for donors to use. That’s the whole point of the single page donation form. You can offer multiple recurring options. Every month for forever, every month for a year, all of those options on the same page. 

It allows for different payment gateways, like [iATS](http://home.iatspayments.com/) - basically, anything supported by Drupal Commerce. Create a contact, indicate which fields you want created, pick a payment gateway, and you’re set. It can be as simple as name, credit card number, and donation amount. It can be as complex as name, credit card, honoree, honoree address, honoree’s favorite color, etc. Payment options allow for text fields, a drop-down menu, or other. Recurring payments open up another myriad of options.

Let’s say you have multiple diff contact types in RedHen because of the campaign. Say I want to send out this particular form because I’m getting money for one campaign. You can have as many donation forms as you have entities that are fieldable. You can create a different form on the same content type.

**Stephanie: Anything else we should know about it?**

**Brandon**:The availability of RedHen Donation within RedHen CRM is a big deal. You don’t have to worry about third-party integration. You don’t have to send people off to another site to collect the donation. You don’t have to wait on a third-party to send that much-needed information back. With RedHen Donation, it just works. It’s all self-contained. If I’m a nonprofit site admin, this is a great option, and a great reason to consider using RedHen CRM because everything needed to collect donations is all in one place.

**Our Conclusion:**

RedHen Donation is a no-brainer for nonprofits who’ve already chosen RedHen as their CRM. Its single-page functionality and recurring donation options make it a must-have for organizations that rely on online donations. For organizations currently shopping around for a CRM, RedHen Donation is a huge plus for RedHen CRM and a compelling reason to select RedHen CRM as your constituent database.
