Well, we're at it again...our team is growing as we take on more and more exciting Drupal web application development projects. ThinkShout is looking to hire both a **senior Drupal engineer** and a **site-builder with project management skills**.

Are you passionate about Drupal web application development? Do you want to be paid to make significant contributions to the open source community? Do you want to go to sleep each night proud of the clients you serve? Are you looking for an employer who will invest in your professional development? Are you looking for a cool geek community with a great location in an awesome progressive town? Do you enjoy organic burritos and acupuncture (both available downstairs from our office). Do you want you want to take your dog to work? Do you want to help choose the Spotify playlists we listen to in the office?

[Lev, Andrea, Brandon and I](/team) care about these things too - and, in large part, that's why we think that we've become such a successful team in just the two short years that we've been working together. Now we're looking to grow the team. Given our commitment to remaining a lean, "high-end, do-good" shop, you are invited to help us iterate on the culture and best practices you've always wanted on a development team.

## More About Us ##

* We work exclusively with progressive organizations in the for-profit, non-profit, and government space. (Sorry, no big corporate or entertainment industry gigs that make you want to cut off your fingers.)
* We have strict engineering standards. We review each other's code. We write code as if every line will be seen by outside eyes (so yeah, a lot of code comments are expected).
* *Abstraction, abstraction, abstraction* - We like to partner with our clients to release cool tools. In fact, most of the Drupal modules we've released were budgeted into billable client projects.
* We don't really care about computer science degrees. We care a ton about self-study.
* We try to keep work to 40 hours per week. But let's face it, the talented folks with whom we all like to work are generally reading and working on personal geek projects after hours and sometimes on the weekends. It's not a requirement, just that sort of our culture.
* While we are developing a product or two, we're first and foremost a services company - and as such, we have to track our time closely. All staff have pretty strict billable hours requirements (lower than other shops in town, but still focused). If you're not comfortable helping the team remain productive and getting projects done on time and on budget - it's probably not a great fit.
* We value communication skills over genius. (Let's face it, we're a small team of passionate technologists, we gotta be able to talk through challenges and opportunities.)
