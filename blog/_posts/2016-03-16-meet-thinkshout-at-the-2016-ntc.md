It’s that [Nonprofit Technology Conference](http://www.nten.org/ntc/) time of year. The NTC is one of our favorite conferences, as it’s an amazing place for us to learn more about the exciting work being done in the nonprofit world. It’s also a great time to for us to share what we’ve been doing, and make connections. So if you’re curious about a job opening we’ve posted, or have a project you’d like to talk to us about, the NTC is a great place to have those conversations! 

There are a few places you can connect with us this year.

## Drupal Day

We’re co-sponsoring [Drupal Day](http://ntcdrupalday.org) on March 22nd along with the fine folks at Aten Design, Four Kitchens, Forum One, Message Agency, and Zivtech. We’ve got a jam packed day of breakout sessions and nonprofit case studies lined up. There’s a great variety of session topics to choose from, from content strategy, Drupal fundraising, and theming to web projects on a nonprofit budget, so there will be something for everyone at Drupal Day!

Want to stop by a ThinkShout-led breakout session at Drupal Day? Lev Tsypin and Amy Vaillancourt-Sals have a couple of sessions on the docket you should check out. Lev will be leading "Fundraising in Drupal" at 9:30 am, and Amy will be leading “Web Development Within Your Means” at 1:45 pm. 

You can check out the full [Drupal Day schedule online.](http://ntcdrupalday.org/#schedule) If you’re planning on attending the NTC, but haven’t registered for Drupal Day and would like to, no problem. Just show up that morning and we’ll take care of the rest.

## Sessions

There are two ThinkShout sessions in the official NTC schedule. Natania LeClerc and Lev Tsypin will be teaming up with Christian Anthony of Earthjustice.org for "[Show, Don’t Tell: Online Storytelling on Digital Media](http://www.nten.org/session/show-dont-tell-online-storytelling-through-digital-media/)" on Wednesday, March 23rd at 3:30 pm. 

On Thursday, March 24th at 1:30 pm, you can catch Brett Meyer, Lara Koch from the Humane Society of the United States, Melissa Barber from North Peak at their session, “[If I Only Had a Frame(work): Crafting User Experiences Across 3rd Party Systems](http://www.nten.org/session/if-i-only-had-a-framework-crafting-user-experiences-across-3rd-party-systems/).”

These sessions are great opportunities for you to see our staff in action, sharing their expertise with the nonprofit tech community. Be sure to follow [Brett](https://twitter.com/brett_meyer) and [Lev](https://twitter.com/levelos) on Twitter for updates on their sessions – and feel free to pick their brains in person!

## Exhibit Hall

**Booth #715** is the ThinkShout HQ at the 2016 Nonprofit Technology Conference. We’re debuting a brand new, super comfy shirt, so be sure to stop by and pick one up. This year, the exhibit hall will be closed during sessions, but you’re guaranteed to find us there during the breaks in between. If you’re looking to talk shop, or learn more about the services we offer, definitely stop by the booth. If you’d like to plan on a specific time to meet in advance, drop us a line and we’ll make it happen.

At the very least, you should stop by our booth for a chance to win your very own Bluetooth BB-8. Or, as we like to call it, our new office best friend. Yes, you’ll get a chance to meet it before you take it home.
