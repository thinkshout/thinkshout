The [Los Angeles Conservancy](https://www.laconservancy.org/) is a nonprofit organization that uses education and advocacy to preserve and revitalize the architectural and cultural resources of Los Angeles County.

The Conservancy needed to replace its aging website with one that was ready for the modern web and that integrated with a new CRM solution built with [Salesforce](http://www.salesforce.com). They needed a website with online mapping features that looked great on mobile devices for on-the-ground use. They also wanted to manage and book their walking tours and other events directly through the site, and to create project-specific microsites. This project allowed us to really flex our engineering and design muscles and it's high time we shed a bit of light on what exactly went into making the Conservancy redesign a reality.

###Our Role###

ThinkShout turned the Conservancy website into an interactive space that highlights the rich and varied architectural history of the greater Los Angeles area.

In collaboration with [YYES](http://www.yyes.org), a Los Angeles-based design agency, we developed a beautiful, responsive website that focused on mobile user experiences.

Collaborating with the CRM specialists at [Kell Partners](http://www.kellpartners.com/), we carried out a deep e-commerce and events registration integration between Drupal and Salesforce. In doing so, we were able to reduce the Conservancy’s software licensing costs substantially and cut out significant complexity in their suite of web-based tools. 

###Critical Features of the Project###

The Los Angeles Conservancy redesign was a great opportunity for us to put our expertise to use and to utilize a variety of great open source tools:

* [RedHen CRM](http://redhencrm.com/) and the Salesforce module (both ThinkShout-led community projects) integrate the site with Salesforce CRM.
* ThinkShout led the mobile-first wireframing process developing of a responsive design, ensuring the design team kept mobile in mind.
* [MapBox](https://www.mapbox.com/) and [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) tools with custom intelligence for integrated mapping were included throughout, including proximity searching and adaptive map layouts.
* The [Panelizer](https://drupal.org/project/panelizer) toolkit was implemented as both a simple page-layout tool for site managers and as a framework for easily creating project "Microsites" to highlight special topics or campaigns with unique branding and sub-navigation.
* Commerce, Registration, and Salesforce tools were integrated to allow paid event registrations online as well as real-time synchronization of registration data with Salesforce.

###Outcomes and Improved Engagement Metrics###

With the redesign, we wanted website visitors to lose themselves in online maps and personal stories of historic places in Los Angeles. Visitors click through the website from building profile to building profile through the use of smart content tagging and “related content” suggestion widgets.

The integration allows for nearly instant updates in Salesforce when users initiate actions on the Drupal website. Additionally, any changes to contacts, event registrations, or membership details are quickly brought back into the website so that users are always presented with the most up-to-date information about the interactions with the Conservancy. 

ThinkShout has helped the Los Angeles Conservancy increase its eCommerce conversion rates dramatically through the simplification of checkout workflows – and more importantly, by providing a seamless event registration and giving experience that was optimized for the mobile web.

Donation callouts are prominent throughout the site, as are opportunities to register for both free and paid tours and special events. Through the event registration process, site visitors can easily include an additional donation when checking out. For easier event registrations in the future, visitors can opt to keep their credit card on file with the website when making payments and donations.

The Los Angeles Conservancy project gave us several opportunities to really put our expertise to use, particularly our mapping application, which was especially applicable given how many locations needed to be digitally curated throughout Los Angeles. We made these sites accessible to their constituents, allowing them to engage quickly and smoothly through the microsites we built for each historic location. We’re thrilled to see our improvements working so well. Donations are up, as is engagement, and we couldn’t be happier about that.
