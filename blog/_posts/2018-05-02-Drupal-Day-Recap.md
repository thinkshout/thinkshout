It feels like it was just yesterday… probably because we still have visions of beignets dancing in our head. But we had such a blast at 18NTC, and we have you, the nonprofit community to thank for it.

Our pre-conference Drupal Day was jam-packed with content from project management to content strategy, to Bene.

Here were some highlights:

<span class="caption"><i class="fa fa-caret-up"></i>Brett and Chris Carrol from University of Chicago Graham School definitely schooled us (sorry) on Content Strategy in Drupal.</span>

We want to give a special shout out to our collaborators from [Gizra](https://www.gizra.com/) and [Fionta](https://fionta.com/) - who contributed to the breakout sessions -- and to anyone who led a BOF (birds of a feather) breakout and conducted a lightning talk to close. We appreciate you adding your voice to the day.  

Next year we’re especially excited about NTC because it’s happening right in our home town of Portland, Oregon! We’re eager to participate and contribute to the rich and vibrant nonprofit community that we deeply care about, and also show you some of what we love best about our hometown.

To stay up to date on everything pre-con / Drupal Day related, (or just to stay in touch!) [sign up for our email list](https://thinkshout.com/contact/). We’ll send a monthly newsletter with the latest trends and case studies to share...and as 19NTC approaches (too soon?) you’ll be first to hear about our plans and how you can join in the fun.

Below is the full agenda from Drupal Day 2018, please [reach out](mailto:natania.leclerc@thinkshout.com) if you would like slides from any of the presentations. Thanks and see you all soon!
