[NTEN’s](http://www.nten.org/) [Nonprofit Technology Conference](http://myntc.nten.org/home) is nearly upon us! We’re gearing up to ship out to Austin, and we’re putting the finishing touches on [Drupal Day](http://myntc.nten.org/eventdetails/precon/drupal). This is one of our favorite events of the year, as it’s when we get to meet up with many of our nonprofit partners, learn about new organizations and their causes, and share our expertise with the folks that need it to further their missions. We’re especially excited about the Drupal Day we’ve been coordinating for the last several months.

What’s Drupal Day? Well, the name pretty much gives it away, but specifically, it’s a full-day, pre-conference event that we’ve been organizing for the past few years. It’s full of Drupal trainings, discussions, and nonprofit technology staff sharing their successes with their community. Breakout session topics vary from content strategy, accessibility, fundraising, CRMs, design, and more, all led by Drupal experts. The day concludes with our keynote presentation on the future of Drupal and Drupal 8 by [Zack Rosen](https://pantheon.io/team/zack-rosen), CEO of Pantheon. All Drupal Day attendees and speakers are invited to join us for a sponsored Happy Hour at the Brass House that evening. Want to stay in the loop on Twitter? Look for the hashtag #15NTCDrupal. Of course, Drupal Day wouldn’t be possible without the help of its co-sponsors, [Aten Design](http://atendesigngroup.com/), [Forum One](http://forumone.com/), [Gorton Studios](http://www.gortonstudios.com/), [Message Agency](https://messageagency.com/), and [Zivtech](https://www.zivtech.com/).

That’s not all we’re up to, though. This year, you can find the ThinkShout team at **booth #301** in the Science Fair on Wednesday and Thursday. Our friends at [MailChimp](http://mailchimp.com/?pid=GAW&source=website&gclid=CIOxieHf-8MCFVFhfgodvBAA_Q) couldn’t attend the NTC this year, but they made sure you wouldn’t go home empty handed. Stop by our booth for your NTC MailChimp swag, and come talk to us about [how we’re integrating Drupal with MailChimp](http://thinkshout.com/blog/category/mailchimp/). We’ve also got a few ThinkShout goodies we’ll be handing out, so be sure to stop by. We’re happy to discuss just about anything under the sun. 

This has been a big year so far for ThinkShout’s open source contributions. We’re particularly thrilled about our recent release of [RedHen Raiser](http://thinkshout.com/blog/2015/01/reimagined-sprints-redhen-raiser/), the first peer-to-peer fundraising tool built on Drupal and RedHen. This is something we’re very excited to share with the nonprofit world, and we’d love to talk to you more about it at our booth.

You'll also be able to see some of the ThinkShout team in action as part of the NTC programming. On Thursday, March 5th, catch Lev Tsypin on the panel ["Sync All the Things! How Progressive Nerds are Changing the Future of Political Data and Integration"](http://sched.co/1z4A) at 3:30 p.m. On Friday, March 6th at 10:30 a.m., Brett Meyer will be co-leading the session [“Content Strategy 101”](http://sched.co/1z4N) with Katie Carrus from the Humane Society Legislative Fund. Brett will also be co-leading the session [“Managing a Tech Project (Or Two or Three)” ](http://sched.co/2ECm)with Lisa Goddard from the Capital Area Food Bank of Texas, Melissa Barber and Brian Pickett from North Peak Solutions on March 5th at 1:30 p.m.
