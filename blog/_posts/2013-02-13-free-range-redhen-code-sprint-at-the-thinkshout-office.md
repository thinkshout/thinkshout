<img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/3vsjjgva9gimabh/redhen_logo.png" style="float: right; margin: -10px 0px 10px 15px">With 2013 well underway, we thought it was time to circle up in the office and bust out an open source sprint.  Our focus this time was on [RedHen](http://drupal.org/project/redhen), our [native Drupal CRM](/blog/2012/06/sean/redhen-crm-part-1), which is fully open sourced and lives on Drupal.org.  In one afternoon, with our team of 8, we were able to give the issue queue some lovin' and also roll the release of RedHen 1.0!

So kudos and applause to [Lev](/team#Lev), [Sean](/team#Sean), [Tauno](/team#Tauno), [Brandon](/team#Brandon), [Brett](/team#Brett), [Gabe](/team#Gabe) and [David](/team#David), ThinkShout's newest team member who was in Portland for the first time, for coding up a storm.  Here's a quick update on the most recent 1.0 releases we've been able to get out the door:

* [RedHen core](http://drupal.org/node/1910206), 'nough said.
* [RedHen membership](http://drupal.org/project/redhen_membership), a separate module to manage association memberships.
* [Entity registrations](http://drupal.org/project/registration), ThinkShout's Drupal 7 answer to Signup which is becoming the defacto Drupal event registration solution.
* [Poultry](http://drupal.org/project/poultry), the responsive theme that can be used to power RedHen's interface.
* [RedHen Demo](http://drupal.org/project/poultry), an installation profile that packages all of RedHen's features into a fictional pet shelter.

As I said, RedHen is fully open sourced and its success is possible due to the support we receive from the community.  So I also want to give a shout out to all of the [contributors](http://drupal.org/node/1068848/committers) who submitted patches.

Sometimes the message is at least as important as the code behind it. As such, our wordsmith Gabe Carleton-Barnes made the [RedHen project page](http://drupal.org/project/redhen) decipherable and, dare I say, fun?
