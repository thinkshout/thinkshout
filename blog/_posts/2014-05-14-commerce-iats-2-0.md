GET EXCITED, E-COMMERCE FANS

Last month, we released the 2.0-beta release of the Commerce iATS module, a Drupal module that leverages Drupal Commerce to add support for payment processing via [iATS Payments](http://home.iatspayments.com/).

We put a lot of thought into refactoring the structure of Commerce iATS in the beta to give us a solid foundation for what we released this week; Commerce iATS 2.0.

2.0 is packed with new features and is, in our opinion, the greatest Commerce module ever created.

In addition to supporting credit card payments, Commerce iATS now supports ACH/EFT, meaning your users can now make payments directly from their bank account.

Drupal Commerce could always handle recurring payments using the Commerce Card on File Recurring module, but iATS Payments is good enough to handle that for you. In Commerce iATS 2.0, you can opt to have iATS Payments bill your customers on a recurring schedule that you define.

Recurring payments are great for donations, which fits in with iATS Payments' goal of supporting the needs of nonprofit organizations.

Because iATS Payments supports international payments, we made sure that you can too. Commerce iATS 2.0 fully supports Direct Debit for the UK.

If you're familiar with Direct Debit, you'll know that any website using the service is required to implement a very specific checkout process.

With assistance from iATS Payments, we've done all the work for you. Commerce iATS now provides a set of custom checkout panes for the whole Direct Debit process. We even figure out the 12-day lead time on the initial payment for you. You're welcome, Drupal community. You're welcome.

In addition to the new features, we took time to make the module more robust. The Payment Methods Admin Page will now warn you if you have any unconfigured payment methods enabled.
