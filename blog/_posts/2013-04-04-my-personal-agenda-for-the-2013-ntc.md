<p>I’m in the somewhat novel position of having helped plan the agenda for the <a href="http://www.nten.org/ntc">2013 Nonprofit Technology Conference</a> but going as an attendee for the first time -- which is very exciting. People tell me the NTC is the best event of its kind, so I look forward to experiencing it without being pulled in five directions at once.</p>

<p>Outside of the two plenaries, here are the sessions I hope to attend in Minneapolis.</p>

<h3>Thursday, April 11</h3>

<p><em>9:00 am - 3:00 pm</em><br />
<strong><a href="http://myntc.zerista.com/event/member/76160">Drupal Day for Nonprofit IT Professionals</a></strong></p>

<p>ThinkShout is co-sponsoring <a href="http://myntc.zerista.com/event/member/76160">Drupal Day</a>, and I’ll be presenting the first session, “Getting Started with Drupal". If you’re thinking about using Drupal (and like Stormtroopers), come check it out. After that, I’ll be hanging around the event to chat and answer questions while a great cadre of Drupal experts expand on the power of everybody’s favorite CMS.</p>

<p><em>3:00 pm - 7:00 pm</em><br />
<strong><a href="http://www.nten.org/ntc/science-fair">Science Fair</a></strong></p>

<p><a href="http://techcafeteria.com/blog/2013/03/01/where-ill-be-at-the-ntc-2013-edition/">As Peter Campbell notes</a>, the Science Fair is not your typical exhibit hall; it’s really more of a place to chat with the vendors about the possibilities of nonprofit technology without a hard sell. Plus, this will be the first time I’m eligible to enter all the drawings.</p>

<h3>Friday, April 12</h3>

<p><em>10:30 am - 12:00 pm</em><br />
<strong><a href="http://myntc.zerista.com/event/member/65142">Secrets of the Content Marketing Sorcerers</a></strong></p>

<p>The wonderful <a href="https://twitter.com/kivilm">Kivi Leroux Miller</a> will moderate this session about content marketing, where <a href="https://twitter.com/volmatchRobert">Robert Rosenthal</a> from VolunteerMatch and I will give concrete examples of what we’ve tried at our organizations (NTEN, in my case).</p>

<p><em>1:30 pm - 3:00 pm</em><br />
<strong><a href="http://myntc.zerista.com/event/member/65169">Need a New Website? Wait! Have You Gone Through a Discovery Process?</a></strong></p>

<p>Yes, I’m going to go to some sessions I’m not speaking at. This is just how the schedule played out. Join <a href="https://twitter.com/sean_larkin">Sean Larkin</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/brett_meyer">I</a> for an in-depth look at what you need to do before you write the first line of code for your new website.</p>

<p><em>3:30 pm - 5:00 pm</em></p>

<p>Here we come to my first real dilemma. Do I go to “<a href="http://myntc.zerista.com/event/member/65112">Social Change Anytime Anywhere</a>" to get <a href="https://twitter.com/amyrsward">Amy Sample Ward</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/WomenWhoTech">Allyson Kapin</a> to sign my copy of their book? Or maybe “<a href="http://myntc.zerista.com/event/member/65105">What Public Radio Can Teach Nonprofits About Effective Storytelling</a>"? <a href="https://twitter.com/willcoley">Will Coley</a> <a href="http://www.nten.org/articles/2013/what-nonprofits-can-learn-from-public-radio-about-storytelling">wrote an excellent article on the subject</a>, and it’s sure to be full of interesting audio examples.</p>

<p>Given my new position, however, I’m leaning toward joining <a href="https://twitter.com/peterscampbell">Peter Campbell</a> for “<a href="http://myntc.zerista.com/event/member/65198">Project Management: Choosing the Right PM Tools and Approach for Disparate Projects</a>".</p.

<p><em>7:00 pm - Some point past my bedtime</em><br />
<strong><a href="http://www.nten.org/ntc/progressiveparty">Progressive Party</a></strong></p>

<p>The Progressive Party’s taking place on a Friday for the first time? I can only imagine the carnage.</p>

<h3>Saturday, April 13</h3>

<p><em>10:30 am - 12:00 pm</em><br />
<strong><a href="http://myntc.zerista.com/event/member/65129">From Empathy to Innovation: Design Thinking for Nonprofits</a></strong></p>

<p>A topic I know just enough about to understand that I should know more.</p>

<p><em>1:30 pm - 3:00 pm</em><br />
<strong><a href="http://myntc.zerista.com/event/member/65139">The Mathematics of Fundraising: An Equation of the Heart</a></strong></p>

<p>This has nothing to do with my job, but after attending his sessions at the last two NTCs, I invited <a href="https://twitter.com/jeffshuck">Jeff Shuck</a> to speak (virtually) at an NTEN staff retreat a few months ago. I understand he’ll be touching on similar material in this session. If you haven’t heard Jeff speak in person yet, you should really come check this one out.</p>

<p><em>3:30 pm - 5:00 pm</em><br />
<strong><a href="http://myntc.zerista.com/event/member/65170">Get Your Motor Running: Revving up with Data Visualization</a></strong></p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/kvoelker">Kurt Voelker</a> <a href="http://www.nten.org/articles/2011/data-and-storytelling-6-ways-to-use-data-to-move-your-mission">wrote one of the best received articles</a> in NTEN history -- on data visualization. Great topic, great presenter.</p>

<p><em>5:00 pm - 7:00 pm</em><br />
<strong>Geek Games</strong></p>

<p>Miss the chance to watch <a href="https://twitter.com/Brendan_at_nten">Brendan</a> play dodgeball? I don’t think so. That guy chases bears for fun.</p>

<p>How does your schedule compare to mine? Did I overlook any session I need to attend?</p>
