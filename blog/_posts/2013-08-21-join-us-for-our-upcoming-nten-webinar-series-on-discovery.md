At this year's <a href="http://nten.org/ntc">Nonprofit Technology Conference</a>, Brett Meyer and I had the opportunity to present on ThinkShout's discovery process. This session kicked off a number of great follow-up conversations with nonprofit web teams about requirements gathering, prototyping, and project planning. More and more, nonprofits are recognizing the importance of discovery in kicking off their website redesign efforts.

Responding to this interest, we are excited to announce that ThinkShout is partnering with <a href="http://nten.org">NTEN</a> to offer a two-part webinar on requirements gathering and information architecture in early September. Space is limited, so [sign up today](http://www.nten.org/events/webinar/2013/09/04/webinar-need-a-new-website-wait-have-you-gone-through-a-discovery-process-understanding-target-audi-3) to join us for this series:

## Need a New Website? Wait! Have You Gone Through a Discovery Process?

### September 4th, 11-12pm Pacific

#### Understanding Target Audiences, Content, and Features

Website redesigns can be overwhelming--from selecting a vendor, to budgeting, to managing implementation, to training, to launching and maintaining a new site. It's easy to dive into the technical details and decisions too soon without taking a step back to consider the motivations of your site visitors and your goals for increasing meaningful engagement with your stakeholders.

In this webinar, we outline an effective approach to beginning a website redesign project that is often referred to as “discovery.” Using this thorough discovery process, you can help your organization set the stage for a new website that promotes engagement and focuses your energies and budget on key functionality that truly support your organizational mission.

In this webinar, we will provide participants with a framework and strategies for clearly documenting website redesign goals, identifying target audiences, and envisioning website features that speak to those audiences. This session will culminate with an exercise called "Cores & Paths" that will help participants begin shaping features and content strategy for a website redesign. Join us again for a follow up on September 11 to continue to explore the website discovery process.

Takeaways:

1. How to plan website features that resonate with your organization's stakeholders and target audience
2. How to manage a website redesign budget and prioritize features
3. How to work with website vendors and key organizational stakeholders

#### Information Architecture, Wireframing, and Project Planning

Website redesigns can be overwhelming–from selecting a vendor, to budgeting, to managing implementation, to training, to launching and maintaining a new site, there's a lot that goes into the redesign process.

It's easy to dive into the technical details and decisions too soon without taking a step back to consider the motivations of your site visitors and your goals for increasing meaningful engagement with your stakeholders. In this webinar, we outline an effective approach to beginning a website redesign project that is often referred to as “discovery”. Using this thorough discovery process, you can help your organization set the stage for a new website that promotes engagement and focuses your energies and budget on key functionality that truly support your organizational mission.

Participants will learn about tools and tips for having a clear approach to developing information architecture and feature specification for a website redesign. Building upon the "Cores & Paths" exercise from the session on September 4, we will teach participants how to iteratively develop key information architecture documents such as a site map and clickable wireframes. From there, we will explain how to turn these assets into an effective RFP document, and more importantly, how to translate this documentation into a successful features specification, budget and project plan.

Takeaways:

1. How to develop an effective site map and clickable wireframes
2. How to translate these information architecture documents into an effective project plan and development roadmap
3. How to manage the implementation of a website redesign, using your discovery documentation as a quality assurance tool
