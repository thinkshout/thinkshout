**(1) How to kill your brand in one step.**

We’re highly disappointed in the marketing stunt that The North Face and its ad agency pulled last month, when they [hacked Wikipedia in order to climb to the very top of Google search results.](https://wikimediafoundation.org/2019/05/29/lets-talk-about-the-north-face-defacing-wikipedia/) [Wikimedia Foundation]

**(2) Case study: User research really can drive tremendous revenue.**

We're big on [user research at ThinkShout](https://thinkshout.com/work/anitab/), which is why it's no surprise to us that [when the California Symphony undertook audience research, it doubled its ticket-buying audience.](https://datebook.sfchronicle.com/music/how-did-california-symphony-increase-ticket-sales-by-listening-to-its-audience) _[San Francisco Chronicle]_

**(3) How to do cause marketing right.**

We're all in the business of cause marketing, and we think there are some [great, actionable learnings](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-resources/land-o-lakes-cause-marketing) from Land O’Lakes here on their recent efforts.  [Think with Google]

Sounds impossible, but [the latest XPRIZE award is doing just that, and at incredible scale.](https://apnews.com/ba76a4a77f874d6db73494145d75e89d?cid=pt) _[AP NEWS]_

**(6) $37 billion is soon to flood into charity efforts.**

Mackenzie Bezos is among 19 of the newest signatories to [The Giving Pledge](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/28/business/mackenzie-bezos-giving-pledge/index.html)—where the world's richest people dedicate half their fortunes to charity.  _[CNN]_


**(7) Invest in measurement.**

At ThinkShout we’ve been ramping up our measurement and reporting efforts on the products we build for our clients. We found it timely then, that Google wrote this piece about [how investing in measurement strategies leads to increased gains.](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-resources/data-measurement/better-marketing-measurement/) [Think with Google]
