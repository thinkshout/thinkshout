It’s that time of year again - that’s right, DrupalCon! We’re excited to visit sunny (and warm, and apparently very dry) Los Angeles this year for DrupalCon 2015. We might have to dust off our shorts for this one.

The location for this year’s conference holds a special place in our hearts, as we have a handful of awesome clients and partners (and some friends, too) that we can’t wait to see while we geek out about all things Drupal. As always, we’ll all be running around during this four day event, but here are all the specific places where you can catch up with us:

## Exhibit Hall##

We’re partnering with our friends MailChimp at booth 800. Stop by for some cool swag, to talk shop, and learn about the exciting work we’re doing porting the MailChimp module to Drupal 8. We’re also hiring for [several positions](/careers/), so if you’d like to meet face to face and get a better feel for what it would be like to join the ThinkShout team, come chat with us.

And finally, as we mentioned earlier, we’re excited about visiting LA this year because we’ll get a bit of face time with some of the great west coast clients and partners we’ve been working with over the last few years. We will be hosting a special happy hour reception celebrating these LA organizations and honoring one of our long-time clients and partners, the [Los Angeles Conservancy](/work/la-conservancy/), with a donation from our team.

We hope to see you at DrupalCon this year. If you can’t make it, get in touch with us and we’ll fill you in on what you missed! You can also follow along on all the social networks: [Twitter](https://twitter.com/thinkshout), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ThinkShout), and [Instagram](https://instagram.com/thinkshout/) - we’ll keep you posted!

To those of you heading down to LA, California or BUST!
