We just can't believe what we're reading this week. Twitter still won't ban those who violate their terms of service, the website of the 2020 Presidential candidates aren't accessible to the blind, and AI could end up replacing your boss instead of you. It's the Weekly Spark!

**(1) Just ban them. Full stop.**

A questionable approach to Twitter’s lack of actually banning high-profile users — [the company will instead label tweets that violate terms of service and leave those tweets available](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/06/27/twitter-adds-labels-tweets-that-break-its-rules-putting-president-trump-companys-crosshairs/?fbclid=IwAR1QZ7ivUen7mE1kk1AGSquas-tHqxRSw9njOMSnf_oZrwJLCp1hBM3-6rM&utm_term=.e70d3f7dd9dd) if Twitter determines it “may be in the public’s interest for [them] to remain available”. _[Washington Post]_

**(2) New podcast alert!**

[Revision Path](https://glitch.com/culture/revisionpath/) is an award-winning weekly interview podcast that showcases the best Black graphic designers, web designers, & web developers. Check ‘em out! _[Glitch]_

**(3) In mobile, CTA placements are everything.**

[Why some mobile CTA buttons seem intuitively “right” and others don’t.](https://uxmovement.com/mobile/the-optimal-placement-for-mobile-call-to-action-buttons/) _[UX Movement]_

**(4) The 2020 presidential candidates on accessibility (or lack thereof).**

Thirty-five million eligible voters are disabled, and disability turnout lags behind that of nondisabled voters by 6 percentage points; if disabled people voted at the same rate as their nondisabled counterparts, there would be 2.2 million more voters. [Why then do NONE of the 2020 candidates have a website that is fully accessible to those who are blind?](https://www.vox.com/first-person/2019/6/26/18759522/2020-candidates-disability-issues-blind-accessible) _[Vox]_

**(5) Memo from Slack itself: Unplug from Slack.**

Slack often pulls us into a mode of perpetual responsiveness, [which is why it’s so interesting to learn that Slack’s office itself has a culture that fully disconnects by 6:30pm, and weekend messages are considered rude.](https://www.fastcompany.com/90367875/how-the-people-who-built-slack-use-it-without-going-bonkers) _[Fast Company]_

**(6) The more you know...**

[As Pride Month comes to a close, we look at 6 moments in contemporary LGBTQ design history you should know.](https://www.invisionapp.com/inside-design/6-moments-lgbt-design/) _[Inside Design]_

**(7) AI may not replace your job, but it might replace your boss.**

A call center shares their experience with AI that tracks productivity of its employees—[but AI that judges performance without any human interaction (or judges based on a biased scale) is definitely absolutely 100 percent something to be wary of.](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/23/technology/artificial-intelligence-ai-workplace.html) After all, great managers understand nuance, and AI really can’t handle anything that isn’t clearly defined. _[The New York Times]_
