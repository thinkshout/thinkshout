Memories of beignets from New Orleans and the #18NTC (Nonprofit Technology Conference) may still be dancing in our heads...but it's time to look ahead towards [#19NTC](https://www.nten.org/ntc/) in none other than our hometown, Portland, Oregon!

And since this will be happening in our neck of the woods, we hope you vote for our NTC sessions by **midnight on Thursday, August 31st!** It's part of NTEN's process to allow you, the attendees of this conference, to speak up about what interests you. And we hope some of what we're offering piques your interest at least as much as the prospect of seeing the Unipiper (Portland's unofficial mascot) in real life.

So check 'em out, give us some votes, and look at all the sessions listed too (they're pretty incredible!). #19NTC is shaping up to be especially amazing and it's no doubt due to the giving and supportive nature of this community.

## [Accessibility By Design](https://www.nten.org/ntc/vote/proposals/accessibility-by-design/?search=Accessibility)
With 40.7 million disabled individuals in the US alone, accessibility is not an edge case, but rather an ethical imperative. Making your website work for more users is not difficult, but it takes intentional design and engineering, a willingness to learn, and empathy. This session will discuss tactical ways to approach accessibility during a website redesign, and how to evolve an existing website to be more accessible.

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Design best practices for accessible design
- Understanding how to build an accessible site and admin experience
- Tools available to you to evaluate your creative and administrative assets

## [Content Migration: From the Lift and Shift to a Complete Overhaul](https://www.nten.org/ntc/vote/proposals/content-migration-from-the-lift-and-shift-to-a-complete-overhaul)
Migrations can range from a single content type to over 10,000 pieces of content, and can make or break a website redesign project. But what type of migration is right for your organization? Through several different migration case studies, we’ll explore how to define goals and evaluate content to ground your decision-making, different tools and approaches for conducting content migrations, and the risks involved and how to avoid them.

**Learning Outcomes:**
- How to make decisions as an organization about what content to keep or archive.
- Understanding the approaches and benefits of automated vs. manual migrations of content.
- How to balance creating new content with migrating existing content you want to keep.

- Use data to inform user experience enhancements.

## [End the Guessing Game: What Does Your Audience Really Think & Do](https://www.nten.org/ntc/vote/proposals/what-do-your-users-really-want)
You want to reach, inspire, and motivate more people, right? We all do. But it can be easy to overlook one of our best sources of insight on who our audiences really are and what they want: our users themselves. User research is an invaluable tool that can clue us in to all this and more.

**Learning Outcomes:**

- Process for running a competitive analysis
- Utilizing user research to inform your marketing and engagement strategies

## [Mapping your Digital Ecosystem](https://www.nten.org/ntc/vote/proposals/mapping-your-digital-ecosystem)
Rather than looking at systems such your website and CRM as silos, wouldn’t it be better to understand how all of your tools fit together? In this session, we’ll walk through how to map your digital ecosystem, and how use that insight to create a roadmap for improvements which could include automated integrations, select custom functionality, and new tools to replace legacy systems. When the journey is complete, your team will be more efficient, you will gain a holistic view of how your constituents engage with your organization, and you can create more personalized, compelling digital experiences for your users.
