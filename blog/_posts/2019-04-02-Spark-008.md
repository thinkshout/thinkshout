From how not to do a TV feature on women without featuring women, to how you can attract a more diverse applicant pool, here's another Spark to kickstart your week. This issue is brought to you by [Chelsea](https://thinkshout.com/team/chelsea/), [Kate](https://thinkshout.com/team/kate/), [Natania](https://thinkshout.com/team/natania/), [Sarah](https://thinkshout.com/team/sarah/), and the rest of the ThinkShout team.

**(1) Here’s how to write a gender inclusive job posting.**  

We all loved this post full of practical advice and tips on [how to center and welcome applicants who identify across the gender spectrum](http://www.pdxwit.org/blog/2019/03/18/how-to-write-an-inclusive-job-posting). [PDXWIT / Portland Women in Tech]

**(2) Get more from your RFPs.**  

Check out these [six ways you can improve your RFPs](https://medium.com/threespot/rfps-dont-have-to-suck-492bc20f0466), make solid digital investments, and hopefully have more money left over to invest directly in the causes you love. _[Medium]_

**(3) Finally, a stock photo library that includes nonbinary folks!**  

It can be challenging to find authentic, diverse representation in stock photos. Check out this new [photo library of nonbinary individuals](https://broadlygenderphotos.vice.com/) that goes beyond the clichés of holding a trans flag. [The Gender Spectrum Collection]

**(4) “Read time” labels are making their way to the mainstream.**  

Turns out that listicles aren’t the only or even necessarily the best way to grab and hold attention: shorter isn’t inherently better! [By publishing read times, it seems like the average time we spend reading one piece online might be going up](https://medium.com/@howard24/a-5-minute-read-about-the-x-minute-read-and-longform-writing-7fe5949798a6). _[Medium]_

**(5) Did you catch the 60 Minutes on women in tech that featured zero women?**  

When 60 Minutes wanted to better understand what initiatives were proving effective in closing the gender gap in tech, they sought out well-known women-led programs. Why then did they only feature a male CEO in the final segment? See what [Girls Who Code](https://onezero.medium.com/erasing-women-in-tech-how-60-minutes-ignored-womens-voices-stories-and-expertise-7ee8e157c262) and [littleBits](https://medium.com/@ayahbdeir/an-insiders-look-at-why-women-end-up-on-the-cutting-room-floor-71a4865a15b0) had to say about it. _[Medium]_

**(6) We love this platform for helping women and girls in tech.**  

[`#BuiltByGirls` platform Wave](https://www.forbes.com/sites/erinspencer1/2019/03/08/in-a-world-builtbygirls-female-mentorship-thrives/#532fcdc92fbd) offers the kind of holistic pipeline of support that is lacking in the tech industry and lacking mention in the aforementioned 60 Minutes interview. _[Forbes]_

**(7) How extremism happens so easily on YouTube.**  

With the New Zealand shooting being optimized for social media virality, this article illustrates just how much [one platform’s algorithm boosts extreme content](https://medium.com/@guillaumechaslot/how-youtubes-a-i-boosts-alternative-facts-3cc276f47cf7). _[Medium]_
