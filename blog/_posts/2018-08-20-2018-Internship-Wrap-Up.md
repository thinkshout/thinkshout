Hard to believe, but summer is rapidly coming to a close. And with that, we must say goodbye to another amazing set of summer interns at ThinkShout. This year, we had them work on a number of projects...from getting their hands dirty in building websites we’re working on for international nonprofits, to creating a new site on Bene for the Street Trust (to be revealed at a later date!).

We asked our interns to tell us in their own words what the last few months have been like for them. Here’s what they had to say:

## What has this internship been like for you?

_*Sadio*_
My internship at Thinkshout has been one of the best experiences of my life. I learned so much the few weeks that we have been here. I have never been so excited to wake up early in the morning and commute to work. Everyone on the team was really welcoming and encouraging and the overall experience was just amazing.

_*Naily*_
Without a doubt, interning at ThinkShout this summer has been one the most impactful experiences of my life. With each passing day, I took in valuable information that not only helped me develop technical skills, but influenced my life goals. Most of all, this summer has been a demonstration that with continuous drive and passion, nothing is out of reach.

_*Kiele*_
Three words: eye-opening, informational and inconceivable (for my Princess Bride fans out there).


## How did this internship differ from what you were expecting?

_*Sadio*_
When I was first matched with Thinkshout through the ELI program, I was a little worried that I would not get past the interview because I didn’t know any PHP. When I got the internship, I was still a little apprehensive and worried that I would not be able to keep up. Fortunately, the team had great documentation and specs for all the tasks we were assigned and I was able to get my work done easily (and I learned some PHP too!). I also had the support of Amy (the best manager that I could ever ask for), she motivated me to try new things and always encouraged me whenever she saw me struggling.

_*Naily*_
Before working at Thinkshout, I was unaware of how impactful the company culture is in regards to the employee experience. Because of this, I expected the Thinkshout company culture to be similar to past work environments. Fortunately, I could not have been more wrong! I was pleasantly surprised to see that the company’s culture fostered learning, personal growth, and social/environmental consciousness. This completely aligned with my personal values, and thus helped me thrive during this internship.

_*Kiele*_
Well first off, I didn’t expect the company culture to be so relaxed. When I thought of this job, I thought of like an agency where everyone wore suits and dresses and got little to no sleep. For context, my dad works for a very well known tech company, and he’s incredibly overworked. The expectations are forever higher than what can be produced...but here, Thinkshout cares about their employee’s lives because if they aren’t happy or well rested, they can’t do their job efficiently. Going to a place where the employees want the best for each other, for them to take days off if they need it, not work weekends or evenings is unimaginable in my mind. But it exists!


## What have you learned (could be about coding, about yourself, about agency life)?

_*Sadio*_
I learned how important company culture is. I was introduced to a world where everyone wanted the best for each other and supported one another to grow and learn. Seeing this made me really excited about coming to work and made me want to contribute back to the team as much as I could.

_*Naily*_
Perhaps one of the most valuable things I learned this summer was how small scale actions can create large scale change. For example, I assisted in the implementation of a website for a non-profit that uplifts women in areas of conflict. Though creating a website is not directly related to what some may consider social work, the website will ultimately help the organization gain more exposure, credibility, as well as donations; resulting in progress toward global and social change. Thus, the work we do and the action we take — no matter how big or small — always contributes to larger solutions.

_*Kiele*_
I’ve learned how to use applications like Sketch, gained practice with project management sites, learned the process of creating a website within a company, gained technical skills in Adobe software, but the largest learning experience revolved around myself.

With my upcoming graduation in December, I questioned whether or not I would be ready for the world outside academia. Will I be proficient enough in design to be able to get a job before or close to graduation? Do I have enough experience under my belt to be a successful designer? Do I have the inherent talent to even be a designer? And my answers to all of those are now an emphatic yes. I never believed my professors when they told me I will have no problem getting a job and that I’m talented. It wasn’t until I began creating and designing at ThinkShout that I realized I have what it takes. I’m still learning, but I should always be learning and striving to figure out a better way of doing something. I learned that the best way to succeed is to put yourself in uncomfortable situations so that you can learn, grow, and become a better person from that experience.
