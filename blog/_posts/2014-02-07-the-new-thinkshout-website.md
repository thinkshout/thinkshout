  The New ThinkShout.com: The Cobbler’s Kids Get Fancy New Shoes
author: brett-heckman
short: We are proud to unveil our new website.
---

There's an allegory in the world of professional services about the *cobbler's kids*. In this story, the cobbler, a highly skilled craftsman, is so busy making fine shoes for his customers that he has no time to replace the worn out, shoddy shoes that his kids wear. The parallels are unfortunately clear here at ThinkShout. We pour our time into our clients' websites and sometimes our own website falls to the wayside. This year, we knew that had to change. We are armed with new, exciting tools and approaches and we thought it high time to use them on our own site.

The end result was not only a new web presence, but a solution we believe may benefit other organizations with similar goals.

### Goals for the redesign
When we launched the first version of our website three years ago, we were just starting to embrace [responsive design](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design). Also, Drupal 7 was still in alpha and we were excited to see what it had to offer over Drupal 6. So, we took our first website launch as an opportunity to explore Drupal 7 as a mobile-first platform.

This first responsive Drupal 7 project, and the many more that we've done since then, have taught us a great deal about the challenges involved in leveraging a robust, *heavy-weight* content management system like Drupal to build elegant, seemingly-simple brochure sites. Of course, you can meet these goals with Drupal, but given some of Drupal's complexities, sometimes it's a bit more than what you need to tell a story online through design, content and imagery.

So, for our redesign, we decided to explore other platform options, and began the project with the following goals:

* Embrace a *storytelling* approach in the information architecture, design and content of the new website.
* Create a site that reflected our focus on user experience and responsive design.
* Play with a new cutting edge open source technology.

### Discovery
As with all of our projects, this one began with a structured discovery process. But this time, we were our own clients - which can be both a blessing and a curse. (We’re our own toughest critics, right? Yeah, the ones used to running around in shoddy shoes...)

To get started, we did a thorough study of our website's target audiences by examining three key metrics: Google Analytics, our sales leads, and the comments on our blogs (except for spambots. Those guys weren’t helpful). From this study, we established profiles of our our audiences and learned which areas of our site resonated with them respectively.

We found that our website was attracting two key audiences that exhibited measurable behaviors:

* Nonprofit communications specialists, the majority of our perspective clients, spent very little time on the site as a whole, but they sat on our staff and portfolio pages for the majority of that time. This suggested to us that they were interested in learning more about our experience *serving real-world clients* and that they were deeply interested in getting to know our team personally as consultants and strategic partners.
* Meanwhile, technology decision-makers and our fellow developers in the open source community showed greater interest in technical blog content. This suggested that these individuals where either looking for quick insights and programming tutorials that would make their jobs easier, or they were evaluating our technical chops in considering employment with us.

How did this insight affect our goals for the redesign? I'm glad you asked:

1. We were reminded of the fact that we needed to make sure that the descriptions of our portfolio work and expertise were accessible to nontechnical audiences (we’re geeks and we sometimes take for granted that people know the terminology we’re using).
2. We realized that the new site needed to center around the *people* of ThinkShout, highlighting the approachability and good hearts of our staff, as well as our passion for technology, content strategy, user experience, and working with nonprofits.

### Embracing a content-first approach
Content. Content, content, content. Our audiences haven't been coming to us to dig through a database. They've been coming to learn about us as approachable experts. So, before we started sketching out any information architecture, wireframes or graphic designs, we opened up our favorite editor and started rewriting content.

In doing so, we realized that this redesign was an opportunity for us to really celebrate our team, as well as some of our greatest client success stories. We invested a significant time into rewriting our [team bios](/team/) to let our personalities shine through. We also hired a photographer to professionally capture our smiling mugs, as well as some action shots in our new office. When it came to writing the case studies to represent our [portfolio](/work/), we started from scratch with a focus on the measurable outcomes of our work and how we are supporting our clients make the world a better place.

Sometimes a content-first approach to a website redesign can feel a bit overwhelming (and for our clients, expensive). It requires a great deal of iteration and patience. But ultimately, we found that by focusing on content, we were able to strip out website features and tell a more authentic story that required less of a technology investment. 

### Wireframing and graphic design
After focusing on content, we did some quick paper sketches and then jumped straight into building responsive wireframes in HTML and CSS. This was made easier by leveraging a front end framework called [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/). With HTML and CSS wireframes, we were able to quickly address information architecture issues across a variety of mobile and tablet platforms.

When it came to graphic design, we adopted the emerging best practice of *design in the browser*, as it allowed us to use CSS and HTML instead of Photoshop. While Photoshop-based design can sometimes lead to faster iterations, when responsive design is a requirement, we find designing in HTML and CSS to be much more time-efficient over the course of the project.

### Lessons learned so far
Bottom line, we now have a light-weight, easy to maintain solution that will allow us to craft bespoke user experiences across all aspects of the site.

Of course, I can’t stress enough that this lightweight build isn’t always going to be the best option for our clients. It’s just one of many solutions available and it happened to work beautifully for us, given our requirements. And in the end, we’re happy in our well-fitting new shoes...

### Is there an elephant in the room?
It's no secret that we love Drupal and most of our client work to-date has leveraged Drupal in some capacity. At this point, you've probably deduced that this site is indeed _not built with Drupal_. We used Jekyll instead, a popular static site generator. A forthcoming followup post will explore in depth why we made that choice, the pros and cons, and what it means for our commitment to Drupal. Hint: Nothing, we're as committed as ever to Drupal and the community that we're a part of.
