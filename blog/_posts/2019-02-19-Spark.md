_The Weekly Spark_ is here to kickstart your week. This issue is brought to you by [Chelsea](https://thinkshout.com/team/chelsea/), [Jules](https://thinkshout.com/team/jules/), and [Kate](https://thinkshout.com/team/kate/).

**(1) Not just users and audiences, but people.**

Do the words we use to describe the people we serve ever bother you? [Here’s one UX designer who is no longer calling people “users."](https://medium.com/s/user-friendly/why-im-done-saying-user-user-experience-and-ux-in-2019-4fdfc6b7de23) _[Medium Design]_

**(2) The 2019 Nonprofit Employment Report is out.**

In terms of national employment rate, it’s pretty easy to see how the `#1` and `#2` spots would go to retail trade and accommodation and food services. [But `#3` is the nonprofit industry? That’s a lot of value to the US economy.](https://www.fastcompany.com/90305058/these-4-charts-illustrate-how-valuable-nonprofits-are-to-the-u-s-economy)  [Fast Company]

**(3) Make sure to caption your videos. Here's how.**

Not all captioning and transcription services are equal. It’s good to know [best practices for video transcriptions, captions, and subtitles.](https://www.rev.com/blog/video-captions-different-methods) [Rev]

**(4) Do you rely on individual donors for support?**

When [member-first funding models](http://www.niemanlab.org/2019/02/with-supporting-cast-slate-wants-to-build-the-paid-membership-layer-of-podcasting/) shift in any industry, that impact ripples out to every industry. That's why you should be paying attention to these developments at Slate. [Nieman Lab]

**(5) The rise in sales of printed books teaches us about real-life importance.**

Unlike the iPhone, sales of printed, physical books — that you can hold and dogear pages — have been [rising steadily since 2013](http://theprintingreport.com/2018/05/03/the-rise-in-popularity-of-printed-books-continues/). As technologists, we're here to amplify an important message: Pay attention to your organization's IRL, tangible strategies for outreach and development. [The Printing Report]

**(6) When “not moderating” means the exact opposite...with scary consequences.**

Tech companies continually claim they are not moderating user posts and content. This article not only says otherwise, it gives [alarming insight into how messy — and life-threatening — a job Facebook is actually doing.](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/27/world/facebook-moderators.html) _[The New York Times]_


**(7) There’s an app for everything, right?**

The app marketplace was built by and designed for those with disposable income and time. There’s a big opportunity for more apps to solve social problems — and a huge challenge with financial backing and sustainability. [We need incubators for social+tech like this one.](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/12/opinion/start-ups-apps-social-impact.html) _[The New York Times]_
