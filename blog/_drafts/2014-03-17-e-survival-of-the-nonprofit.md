I’ve volunteered with several nonprofit organizations, but the ones I’ve worked with were deficient in technological education and resource suffrage. I knew there were several online resources for them, but my understanding was that they weren’t necessarily accessible. After attending NTEN’s annual Nonprofit Technology Conference (NTC), I realized that’s not the case. There are accessible resources, you just need to know where to look.

Technological advancement doesn’t seem difficult for the private sector like it is in the nonprofit world. I used to think nonprofits simply couldn’t compete in the digital age with their more stringent fiscal limitations. But experienced technologists do exist in the passionate crop of nonprofit personnel, as evidence by the attendees of NTC. Imagine a child watching cartoons on a television. The cartoons are great, easy enough to fall in love with, but they’re intangible. Now, imagine the child goes to Disneyland for the first time and gets to see all those characters in the flesh… sort of. That was me at the conference. Those cartoons, or in this case, sessions based around technologies, came to life. 

The 2014 NTC sessions explored data and metrics usage, mobile optimization, social network implementation, and a number of related topics. We even organized [Drupal Day](http://thinkshout.com/blog/2014/04/one-size-fits-all-at-Drupal-Day/), which was dedicated pre-conference time for attendees to learn about the development, implementation, and use of Drupal.

So what’s the purpose of this post? To assure cash-strapped organizations that both assistance and information is available and affordable, so nonprofit advocates don’t have to compromise on education, processes, or resources. 

ThinkShout’s own Brett Meyer [mentioned](http://thinkshout.com/blog/2014/04/one-size-fits-all-at-Drupal-Day/) in his session that 85% of nonprofits post articles on their websites and the number of articles they publish increased in 2013. In addition, about 2-3 billion users will access the mobile internet in the next decade. Those numbers dictate the potential amount of information which can reach a nonprofit’s online audience. It’s important to provide nonprofit staff with the right tools to adapt to audiences’ evolving methods of accessing information.

There was another session in which ThinkShout’s Betsy Ensley [discussed](http://14ntc.sched.org/event/ef0a4748e313b3c7d71ab6b7c9ace83b#.U1gnZeZdVh1) project and business process management. The session provided practical and achievable strategies to streamline processes. The notion was that agile and efficient principles should be used throughout different projects to create innovation, reduce risk, and therefore improve digital alignment. It shouldn’t be reserved for large projects, since even small ones affect an organization’s development and operation.

There are several resources available on the web to nonprofits. Scour the internet for information and keep updated with other organizations’ outreach efforts. Whether through [blogs](http://topnonprofits.com/lists/nonprofit-blogs/), [communities](http://www.nten.org/), or [news](http://www.thenonprofittimes.com/).

It’s important to utilize education, processes, and resources. Often, organizations become comfortable in their space and don’t venture out. But the adventure is part of the passion, and the former leads to discoveries that broaden organizations’ visions.
