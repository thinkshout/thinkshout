ThinkShout seeks to hire a senior front end engineer, and by that we mean someone who can build a mobile first responsive site using HTML, CSS, Javascript, SASS/Compass and, perhaps, Zurb's Foundation. And oh yeah, it might also be Drupal, Jekyll, or a custom Node.js backend. The ThinkShout team takes great pride in their craft and their tools and we expect the same from you.

## Qualifications
This job requires some specific skills, but we're also looking for someone who's passionate about the web in general and user experience particular.
### Quantitative
- You have expertise in HTML5, CSS3, SASS/Compass and LESS.
- You are familiar with HTML and CSS prototyping frameworks, such as Zurb's Foundation and Twitter's Bootstrap.
- You have a deep understanding of Drupal's theme layer and "PHP for Drupal."
- You understand why moving to Twig in Drupal 8 is a huge improvement.
- You're just as comfortable manipulating the DOM using JQuery as CSS.
- If Angular, Backbone, and/or Ember are your quiver, even better. They will be soon regardless if you join our team.
- While we prefer to design in the browser, occasionally we need to slice up PSDs in Photoshop. You can handle that.
- You are familiar with Jekyll and other static site generators, and understand the use cases where they work well.

### Qualitative
- You understand mobile first responsive web design and don't understand why we haven't always been doing it this way.
- You are passionate about how a user experiences a website.
- You have an interest in working with new, emergent front end technologies.
- You're a self-starter; you care about your development tools; you stay on top of new technologies and development best practices.

## Compensation Packages
- A competitive salary.
- Comprehensive benefits package including health insurance with dental, vision, and alternative care, a matching 401k, and a very generous 30 day PTO policy.
- Get paid to learn and go to conferences, such as DrupalCon, Dreamforce and the Nonprofit Technology Conference.
- A focus on work/life balance, including a flexible office hours policy.
