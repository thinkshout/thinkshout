ThinkShout is a leading design, strategy, and web development team located in Portland, OR. We envision digital technology and strategy that creates positive change in the world. We craft compelling open source engagement solutions for forward-thinking organizations.

We are looking for a User Experience Designer with a strong background in information architecture to join our Discovery, Strategy, and User Experience team. 

You thrive in crafting elegant solutions to meet the needs of end users while keeping client goals firmly in mind. If you love solving complex problems within a team environment, we want to hear from you. You’ll get to work with great clients like the Southern Poverty Law Center, Mercy Corps, and Facing History and Ourselves. 

Experience in usability testing, content modeling, front-end development, and agile processes is also desired.

## Key Responsibilities
- Crafting the user experience for client websites and applications, from kickoff to requirements gathering and research to the development of information architecture, wireframes, and final designs.
- Clearly articulating and presenting your recommendations to clients.
- Advocating for the end user, across the identified target audiences, both with our clients and internally at ThinkShout.
- Collaborating with the full project team at ThinkShout, including project managers, developers, and strategists, to maintain a cohesive process in delivering the best possible solution to our clients.
- Staying up-to-date on the latest developments in information architecture and user experience design and contributing to the development of our internal processes.
- Serving as a thought leader and subject matter expert through speaking engagements, webinars, industry articles, and blog posts; attend and participate in industry conferences and workshops across the country, as needed.

## Skills and Qualifications
- 5+ years experience in information architecture, user experience, and design, ideally within an agency environment.
- A portfolio that shows both great finished work and the process you took to get there (including site maps, content models, wireframes, mood boards, etc).
- The ability to condense thousands of pages of content into a streamlined system that satisfies client stakeholders across departments, including at the executive level.
- Strong understanding of web development – particularly HTML/CSS/Javascript – and responsive design for desktop, mobile, tablet – and whatever’s next.
- Knowledge of web standards and accessibility guidelines.
- Proven ability to interact with clients, balancing their expectations with your expert recommendations.
- Ability to manage multiple projects in a fast-paced, deadline-oriented agency environment.
- Experience collaborating with others and working in small teams.
- Outstanding writing and presentation skills.
- Experience working with nonprofits is a definite plus, as is a passion for using technology to create social change.

## Compensation Package
- A competitive salary.
- Comprehensive benefits package including health insurance with dental, vision, and alternative care, a matching 401k, life insurance, short term disability insurance, family leave, and a very generous 30 days of PTO (including holidays).
- Get paid to learn and go to conferences like Design Week Portland, Convergence SE, XOXO, and the Nonprofit Technology Conference.
- A focus on work/life balance, including a flexible office hours policy.

## Next Steps
Send us a cover letter focusing on why you're interested in a career at ThinkShout and a resume in PDF format (or your LinkedIn profile). You should also provide as many of the following details as you can.

* Links to your portfolio, completed projects you played a lead role on, and any presentations or published articles related to information architecture or user experience.
* Any questions you might have for us here at ThinkShout.
* An answer to the question: How would you start organizing thousands of pages of disparate content into a coherent system?
