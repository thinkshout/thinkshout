In order to evaluate your Drupal skills, we'd like you to write a simple Drupal 7 module that satisfies the following requirements:

* The module can be enabled and run on any standard Drupal 7 installation.
* Have a normal menu item that triggers a page callback. The menu item can live in the standard navigation or main menu.
* The page callback should return a form implemented using the [Form API](https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/developer%21topics%21forms_api_reference.html/7) containing at least the following elements.
  * Text input field for a number.
  * A second text input field for a number.
  * A submit button
* When the form is submitted, it should return the sum of the 2 numbers in a standard Drupal message or elsewhere on the page.
* As a bonus, validate the form input to ensure the values are numeric.

Please post the module code to GitHub or a Drupal.org sandbox project. While there is no time limit on the test, how long it took to complete, measured from first to last commit, will be a factor.

Good luck and thanks for your interest!
