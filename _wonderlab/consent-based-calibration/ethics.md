I got my start in the relatively early days of the Internet, so early that I still capitalize it! The late 90’s and early aughts, were littered with exciting .com’s, with barely a one having a viable business model in mind. One of my favorites at the time was Kozmo.com, which pioneered the delivery model which ubiquitous today with the likes of Uber Eats, Dash, and Amazon. Back then, though, it was nuts! You could browse the website, which was essentially a visual convenience store, order your Ben & Jerry’s and a DVD (because streaming was still a distant dream!), and have it delivered within an hour by some person a scooter. They even threw in a branded bottle opener for kicks! I don’t know how much they lost on every order, but it was significant, and, unsurprisingly, they went out of business in short order, along with so many others. But before they did, investors and the popular press fully bought into the vision of the company. Why? Well, part of it was blind exuberance, but another big factor was the promise of the data collected and the personalized experience not far behind. Kozmo learned where you live, your movie and ice cream preferences, and when you like to relax. Just imagine the possibilities that presented in the age when telephone surveys and census data counted for cutting edge insights. I was fully bought in. When my “old economy” friends would naively inquire how these .com’s made money, I would scoff and brag about the big data future.

Oops. Well, unfortunately, that future is here, and it is far from the utopia that early dreamers envisioned. It has brought us walled gardens where we are fed an ever-narrower stream of information catering to our worst instincts. Where giant corporations gather terabytes of private information, creating detailed profiles about each of us, that are sold to even bigger corporations so they can target us with sophisticated marketing campaigns. Where we are torn between the convenience of a “smart” speaker in our homes and the fear of being surveilled. Where the dream of equal access to knowledge has given way to the nightmare of politicized echo chambers and the erosion of truth. These early tech dreamers are now corporate titans, who use their billions to increase power through lobbying efforts and the squashing of competition.

But all is not lost! The Internet is still free and open, and we have the power to create experiences that respect our audiences individuality without eroding their identities. Rather than gathering every possible piece of information without a user’s consent, just ask them what type of journey they would like to take. This is not a radical concept. When you walk into a store, you are, typically, not secretly tracked and presented with items to purchase based on your “profile”. A person simply asks what you are looking and if they can help! When you meet people at a party, depending on your mood that night, you get to control how you define yourself, and it’s ok if you’re the outgoing and owning the dance floor one night, and relaxing in the corner and talking with a friend another. Our digital experiences should reflect how we engage with the real world. They should allow us to choose our own personas during an experience, maybe even change them half way through.

We are not a composite of the data collected about us without our consent. We are people whose opinions, needs, feelings, and moods are constantly changing, and a digital experience should calibrate our experiences to match, with our consent. This paradigm it not only ethical and in the best interests of people, it also benefits the organizations they are engaging with. Consent based calibration builds the foundation trust that is needed to deepen engagement, and, ultimately increase whatever conversions a product is trying to achieve.

We have the power and tools to build these products, let’s get started and create a better Internet.
