He designs in the browser, using tools we love like Sass and Jekyll, and doesn’t shy away from large, responsive web challenges. Before ThinkShout (and after the metal band), Josh worked remotely from Florida as a designer at Lullabot. He has since relocated to Portland with his wife and spends his free time hiking, cooking, or honing his photography skills.

  position: Project Manager

    Kaylan is a natural storyteller and problem-solver. She genuinely loves the nature of project management and few things are quite as satisfying to her as seeing our clients’ projects to completion. That love is only rivaled by her passion for fairy tales - the scary kind.

    Before joining ThinkShout, Kaylan managed projects in a wide variety of industries, particularly, education, where she partnered with various universities to design and implement long-term executive coaching programs to increase student retention and engagement.  We love the diversity of her experience and her unwavering enthusiasm for each project she oversees. She has a Master's degree in English literature and is a self-proclaimed research nut. She also really, really loves marine mammals and used to volunteer for the Cabrillo Marine Aquarium in Los Angeles as a whale watch tour guide. She’s the only person in the office who’s toured the Brothers Grimm route in Germany. Spooky.

   Krista’s forte is setting up effective processes that improve our day-to-day operations. She excels at supporting organizations, streamlining the daily complexities that take place behind the scenes. Before finding her way to ThinkShout, she spent some time in California - long enough to decide that all that sun just wasn’t for her. After returning to rainy Portland, she worked as the Office Manager at Metal Toad. Krista studied psychology, business, and education (just for fun) at Western Oregon University. When she’s not busy keeping all of our ducks in a row, she’s tending to her urban farm, raising chickens and growing her own food. She plans to expand her livestock collection to eventually include goats and pheasants. We’re considering implementing a Bring Your Goat to Work Day in the office.

She owns a trumpet, but admits she doesn’t know how to play it.

    Mike’s got a strong knack for the technical details and is accomplished at spearheading digital initiatives for large nonprofits. He has all the traits of an expert cat-herder. And he's apparently never tweeted a day in his life. Too busy managing the nitty-gritty, we assume.

   Mike's experience ranges from serving small grassroots nonprofits to large broadcasting organizations. He was heavily involved in the web design and information architecture of some of Boston’s WGBH popular digital programming, such as American Experience and NOVA. Mike joined the ThinkShout team so that he could continue his work with socially responsible organizations, and he brings a wealth of technical project management experience with him. While he’s got a number of project-related accomplishments under his belt, he says he’s most proud of being a father of three girls who’d rather be fairies and demons than Disney princesses. When he’s not wrangling his kids, he’s enjoying outdoor sports like fly fishing and windsurfing.

   In fact, not only is Nancy a digital agency veteran, but she also has a bunch of really interesting, high profile tech projects under her belt. Prior to programming, Nancy spent several years as a software tester, and that work would eventually inspire her to try her hand at coding. She got her first big break in the development world through Agency.com, where she cut her dev teeth on a site for ABC Sports College Football. Nancy speaks Drupal, has her Magento front end developer certification, and loves learning new programming languages. In addition to her impressive development chops, Nancy has run the Portland marathon 8 times.

She spent several years on United Way of the Columbia-Willamette's marketing and communications team, which prepared her well for her role here. She never ceases to be inspired by the projects she manages and the missions of the organizations we get to partner with. She strives to ensure that the work we deliver makes our clients feel like they have the tools they need to achieve their goals, and open up possibilities for the future. When she’s not ensuring that we’re meeting deadlines, she’s making appearances at local comic cons, or binge watching Doctor Who.

    Having worked extensively in the nonprofit sector, Stephanie knows all too well that keeping your technology up to date and accessible to your constituents is hard to prioritize when working on a tight budget. She has a BA from Gonzaga University and spent three years in freelance video production and content editing for independent online press. She eventually found herself in the nonprofit world, where she spearheaded a social media campaign and developed a communications plan for Families Forward in Southern California. Through this experience, Stephanie developed a great appreciation for open source tools that help nonprofits better engage their constituents and she continues to be an advocate for nonprofit technology. Unlike Inigo Montoya, Stephanie fences left-handed.
