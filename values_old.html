        <h4>A <span>Beneficial </span>corporation</h4>
        <p>
          Since our founding in 2011, our focus has been on building a company that is
          generous to its staff, its clients, and the community. In 2015, we
          formalized this commitment by achieving B Corp certification. As a
          Beneficial Corporation, we have embraced a framework and global movement
          that helps continue to make intentional choices that put people and the
          planet above profit.

        and we contribute back daily. We believe that company culture goes deeper
        than having an office ping pong table.
