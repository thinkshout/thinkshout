    <p>ThinkShout has moved...but not far! We're maintaining our Old Town roots, and as a sign of good faith to the neighboring organizations in the area, we're making our open house a fundraiser benefiting the following groups:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><a target="_new" href="https://blanchethouse.org/">Blanchet House</a></li>
        <li><a target="_new" href="https://www.tprojects.org/">Transition Projects</a></li>
        <li><a target="_new" href="https://sistersoftheroad.org/">Sisters of the Road</a></li>
      </ul>

      <p>There will be music, food, drinks, and views of downtown Portland to enjoy from the 7th floor of 4th and Glisan. Ticket costs benefit the organizations listed above. You may also make a supplemental donation to the organization of your choosing (which you can select on the billing info page!).</p>
