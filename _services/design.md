#### Information Architecture

Every website must provide a balance between structure and flexibility on the front end and and ease of use for content producers on the back end. We develop information architectures for our clients that ensure their site will help them move the needle on their organizational goals. From sketches and prototypes right through the final content model and site map, we design systems that support the content that will resonate with your audiences and move them to support your mission.

#### Mobile-first Wireframes

When we talk about “responsive design” we’re not simply talking about the need to create a mobile-friendly website that works across devices and browsers: we’re talking about future-proofing your site for how people consume content. And our aggregate client data over the last several years has shown a surge in mobile traffic that has no intention of slowing down.

If the site map can be said to represent information architecture in two dimensions, our wireframing process adds visual and spatial hierarchy. Our work with information architecture provides a clear framework for wireframes. Strategists and UX Designers work together to develop a system that is mobile-first and interactive.

Through this process, we’re able to minimize iterations in development and design because our clients can interact with the wireframes and conceptualize the responsive nature of their site on mobile, tablet, and desktop screen sizes very early in the process.

#### Responsive, User-Centered Design

While the user can only view one page at a time, the entire experience must feel holistic. We work to define a visual look and feel that is not only in harmony with your goals and brand, but which inspires action and engagement.

Once the new visual design direction is established, we will begin the process of translating wireframes into desktop, tablet, and mobile designs. We work to create a seamless experience across devices that marries the fluidity and usability of each platform.

We keep the user’s needs in mind with every design decision no matter how small the element. By seeking visual balance throughout each design element, we create unity, flow, and hierarchy.
