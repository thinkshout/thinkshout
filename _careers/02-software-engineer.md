Software Engineers at ThinkShout are responsible for the delivery of world-class open source solutions built with Drupal, PHP, Symfony, Angular, Ember, Ruby, Jekyll, Node.js and anything else that serves our clients, the nonprofit tech community, and is a blast to play (and work) with.

### Qualifications

* TDD, PHP, SQL, JS, SCM, AJAX/AHAH, HTML5, SASS, and CSS (to name a few) are much more than just acronyms to you.
* One year of experience developing with Drupal.
* Two years of experience working with other open source frameworks.
* You get Git.
* Following coding standards and other programming best practices is, well, fun!
* You have an interest in working with new, emergent web technologies and concepts, such as decoupled apps.
* You're a self-starter; you care about your development tools; you stay on top of new technologies and development best practices.
* You don't mind spending time in the programming trenches.
* You want to make a commitment to our team, work, community, and clients.
* The ability to work onsite at our Portland, OR office.

### Compensation Package

* A competitive salary.
* Comprehensive benefits package including health insurance with dental, vision, and alternative care, a matching 401k, life insurance, short term disability insurance, and a very generous 30 days of PTO, including holidays.
* Get paid to learn and go to conferences, such as DrupalCon, OSCON, and the Nonprofit Technology Conference.
* A focus on work/life balance, including a flexible office hours policy.

### Next Steps

Send us a cover letter focusing on why you're interested in a career at ThinkShout, a resume in PDF format or your LinkedIn profile and as many of the following details as you can:

* Links to open source software contributions you have made (code posted to GitHub, Drupal.org, etc.).
* A link to your Drupal.org and/or GitHub user profiles.
* A list of open source conferences you have attended, as well as user groups you have frequented.
* A description of your local development environment and programming workflow.
* Any questions you might have for us here at ThinkShout.
* An answer to this question: If you had to choose one object (other than your laptop) to keep in your team's space, what would it be?

We look forward to hearing from you!
